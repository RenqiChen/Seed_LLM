Transitioning to zero-tillage might require an initial investment in specialized equipment like a zero-till seeder. However, the long-term savings from reduced labor, fuel, and irrigation costs can offset this. Additionally, there are often government subsidies or programs available to support farmers adopting sustainable practices. I recommend checking with local agricultural extension services for any such incentives.\"']]"},
