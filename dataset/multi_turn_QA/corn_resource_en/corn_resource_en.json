How would I implement this planting method in such a scenario?\"', '\"For areas with uneven topography, you can customize the ridge and furrow layout to match the natural contour of your land, which helps in capturing and redistributing rainwater more efficiently. You should consider building higher and wider ridges in the elevated areas, which can help in directing the water flow towards the drier central parts.\"'], ['\"That makes sense. What about the density and spacing of maize plants in this system?

Typically, increasing the density can maximize yield, but you must balance it to avoid excessive competition for light and nutrients. Starting with densities like 60,000 to 90,000 plants per hectare could be a good range to test.\"']]"},
