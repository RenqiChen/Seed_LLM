This study aimed to determine which of two labor-saving establishment methods, i.e., zero tillage and direct seeding (ZTDS) and rotavator tillage and mechanical transplanting (RTMT), achieves higher grain yield in inbred rice. Field experiments were conducted at two sites across three years to determine grain yield and yield attributes of an elite inbred rice variety, Jinlongsimiao, established under ZTDS and RTMT. Results showed that RTMT produced an 11% higher grain yield than ZTDS. Higher spikelet number per panicle was observed under RTMT compared to ZTDS, but spikelet number per m² was not necessarily higher because it was compensated for by a reduced panicle number per m². RTMT established rice conferred higher spikelet filling percentage but lower grain weight than ZTDS established rice. There was no consistent or significant difference in crop growth rate, total biomass production, or the source-sink ratio between RTMT and ZTDS rice. RTMT produced a higher harvest index than ZTDS. These results suggest that RTMT is the favorable method for inbred rice establishment to improve the partitioning of assimilates and consequently increase spikelet filling percentage and grain yield compared to ZTDS.)

    "output": "The text discusses a study comparing two labor-saving rice establishment methods in China: zero tillage and direct seeding (ZTDS) and rotavator tillage and mechanical transplanting (RTMT). The study found that RTMT resulted in an 11% higher grain yield than ZTDS for the inbred rice variety Jinlongsimiao. Although RTMT had a higher spikelet number per panicle, the overall spikelet number per m² did not increase significantly due to a lower panicle number. Additionally, RTMT rice had a higher spikelet filling percentage but lower grain weight compared to ZTDS rice. The study concluded that RTMT is more effective at improving grain yield and assimilate partitioning in inbred rice under the conditions tested.",

The plots were flooded with a water depth of 3-10 cm from 3 days after the third herbicide application until 7 days before maturity. For RTMT, the plots were soaked with a water depth of approximately 3 cm for 7 days followed by a rotavator operation. Pre-germinated seeds were sown in trays at a dry seed rate of 100g tray*. Twenty-days-old seedlings (525 trays ha-1) were transplanted at a hill spacing of 25 cm × 14 cm with about 5 seedlings per hill, using a high-speed rice transplanter (Pz80-25, Dongfeng Iseki Agricultural Machinery Co., Ltd., Xiangyang, China). An herbicide mix, i.e., the wettable powder mixture of bensulfuron methyl (1.1%), acetochlor (16.7%), and metsulfuron-methyl (0.2%), was applied at 7 days after transplantation. A flood water depth of 5-10 cm was maintained from transplanting until 7 days before maturity. All plots received 150 kg N ha, 67.5 kg P20s ha, and 120 kg K20 ha- each year.

The plant samples were hand-threshed after the panicle number was counted. Filled spikelets were separated from unfilled spikelets by submergence in tap water. Three sub-samples of 30g filled spikelets and a total sample of all unfilled spikelets were collected after sun-drying to determine spikelet number. Dry weights of straw and filled and unfilled spikelets were determined after oven-drying at 70° to a constant weight.

Recent studies have shown that consumption of rice, the staple food for about half of the world population, contributes a large proportion of the total intake of inorganic arsenic (As) in populations based on a rice diet, thus posing a potentially significant health risk (Kile et al. 2007; Meharg et al. 2009; Mondal and Polya 2008; Zhu et al. 2008b). Rice appears to be much more efficient in As accumulation than wheat and barley (Williams et al. 2007). These authors analysed 173 paired soil, shoot and grain samples of the three cereal crops collected from different regions of the world. They found a much higher transfer factor (TF, the ratio of plant As concentration to soil As concentration) of As from soil to the shoots of rice (0.05-3.8, mean=0.76) than that of wheat (0.002-0.14, mean=0.018) and barley (0.002-0.095, mean=0.013).

This means that rice grown in soils not contaminated with As (i.e., total soil As<10mgkg-1) could still accumulate sufficiently high levels of As in the grain to be of concern. The problem may be further exacerbated in areas impacted by pollution, such as mining activities (Xie and Huang 1998; Zhu et al. 2008a) or irrigation with As-contaminated groundwater (Meharg and Rahman 2003). Rice straw is often used as a cattle feed in south Asia.

In experiments using seeds without the removal of the endosperm, the effect of low boron treatments (0.18 and 0.03 μM B) was not evident on growth of seedlings until 5 weeks from germination. Analysis of boron distribution among different organs in rice grain demonstrated that the endosperm contained 92% of total boron in brown rice and husks contained twice as much boron as the brown rice. To examine the role of boron stored in the endosperm, endosperm were removed 5 days after de-husking and imbibition and the plants were subjected to boron treatments. The growth of the plants without endosperm was much reduced after 10 days under the 0.03μM boron compared with the plants grown with the normal level (18 μM B). With the normal level of boron supply, the growth did not differ between the plants with and without endosperm, suggesting that growth difference between seedlings with and without endosperm under low B condition is not due to lack of starch or proteins, but due to lack of boron stored in seeds. Tracer experiments confirmed that a substantial amount of B was supplied from the seed to the seedling and that B limitation increased the B supply from seeds to seedlings, especially to roots.

RNAi was first described in Caenorhabditis elegans, and injection of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) into C. elegans cells could trigger sequence-specific RNA degradation (Fire et al.1998). This dsRNA-mediated gene silencing now is referred to as RNA interference (RNAi) and is closely related to post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants (Fire 1999; Sharp and Zamore 2000; Qi and Hannon 2005). The RNAi method has led to the development of new strategies to block gene function; however, some inconsistent results have been observed (Chuang and Meyerowitz 2000; Sunilkumar et al.2006; Xiao et al. 2006; Ma et al. 2011; Yin et al. 2007). Dwarfism has been associated with the gibberellin (GA). The most common method for curtailing unwanted stem elongation is to spray with growth retardants, which act by blocking synthesis of the plant hormone gibberellin (GA) (Rademacher 1991). It is expensive and environmentally undesirable. An alternative approach is to manipulate such crops genetically, the obvious targets being genes involved in GA biosynthesis or response (Fig. 1). Dwarfing is one of the most valuable traits in crop breeding because it results in plants that are more resistant to lodging and have stable increased yields.

The treatment was done at an early grain filling stage using 0.3 and 0.5% w/v ZnSO4-7H2O solution. The spray did not affect the grain yield of rice but decreased the Cd concentration in the root, straw, husk, and brown rice to some extent and increased the Zn concentration. Foliar application of 0.5% ZnSO4 resulted in maximum Zn concentration and minimum Cd concentration in brown rice. However, the concentrations of P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, and Mn in brown rice were not affected. The correlation between Cd and Zn concentrations in brown rice, husk, and root was significantly negative, and that between Cd and Mn concentrations in brown rice was significantly positive. The inhibition of Cd uptake resulted in a decrease in its concentration in brown rice after the treatments. Thus, the foliar application of a suitable concentration of Zn at the early grain filling stage could effectively minimize the Cd concentration while enhancing the Zn concentration in brown rice on Cd-contaminated acid soil.)

The study found that spraying rice with 0.3% and 0.5% ZnSO4 solutions at an early grain filling stage decreased Cd levels in various parts of the rice plant and increased Zn levels, particularly with the 0.5% solution. This treatment did not affect the concentrations of other minerals like P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, and Mn in brown rice. The results indicate a negative correlation between Cd and Zn concentrations, suggesting that Zn application could be an effective method to reduce Cd uptake in rice cultivation on contaminated soils.",

Several studies have shown that in Zn-deficient or low active soil, the foliar application of appropriate amounts of Zn fertilizer can effectively promote crop growth by increasing the Zn nutrition in crops or by alleviating Cd toxicity. For example, foliar spray of 50-400 μmol L-1 ZnSO4 significantly increased the yield of tomato on soil contaminated with 10 mg kg-1 Cd, with 1.9 mg kg-1 DTPA-Zn. Other studies have shown that in Zn-sufficient or high-active soil, the foliar application of Zn did not increase the crop yield. Our study showed that foliar application of Zn had an insignificant effect on the grain yield of rice. This could be because the available Zn content in the experimental soil was much higher than the critical value of Zn deficiency in acid soil (1.5 mg kg-1); thus, foliar application of Zn in this soil had no significant effect on the rice yield.)

As a result, distinct differences in grain weight and quality, including nutritional and cooking traits, can be found among spikelets within a panicle. Uniform size and weight of grains within a panicle are expected in rice production, as large variation will lower both seeding performance and commercial quality. Great efforts have been made to elucidate the effect of grain position within a panicle on grain development and quality, with the aim of reducing differences through genetic and agronomic operations.)

Chin Sci Bull 46024607, doi: 10.1007/s11434-013-6061-2 The centromere is an important element of the plant chromosome, and is where the kinetochore forms and microtubules attach during cell division [1,2]. For the accurate division of genetic material, each chromosome contains a single centromeric DNA region where the centromere and kinetochore are assembled. The centromere is a complex composed of centromeric proteins and DNA motifs in many higher eukaryotes. Although its function is relatively conserved, centromere contains highly divergent DNA sequences [3,4]. Except for the very short centromeric DNA sequence in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is 125 bp in length [5,6]] tandem repeats are classic features of regular centromeres in many other model species [7-11]. The copy number of the repeat units is different in each chromosome, and the tandem repeats are interspersed with retroelements [12]. In contrast to the DNA sequences, the functional proteins of centromeres are relatively conserved among eukaryotes [13,14]. The centromere-specific histone H3 variant (CENH3; known as CENP-A in mammals) is the key centromere-specific protein and a fundamental feature of plant functional centromeres [13,15-21]. In the active centromere, CENH3 replaces the canonical histone H3 in histone core of centromeric nucleosomes, and ensures the chromosome can be correctly transmitted during cell division [22]. If the centromere loses its function, CENH3 is not assembled at the centromeric region [23-28]. Thus, CENH3 is a good marker for assaying centromere activity as it is only found in functional centromeres.) ",

CENH3 is crucial for the functionality of centromeres, replacing the canonical histone H3 in active centromeres to ensure proper chromosome transmission during cell division.

Of the total of 209 genes identified, unigene provides evidences for 164 (Table 2). Of these only 22 are truncated while the rest are complete matches. This finding was expected as it has been suggested that more than one copies of a gene are simultaneously expressed in plants (Raue and Planta 1991, Wu et al. 1995). The ultimate objective of a cell is to maintain a stoichiometric balance between all the components of ribosome, so as to allow a smooth assembly of the molecular machine. There are various theories on the primary level of regulation of gene expression. It could occur at transcriptional, translational or post-translational level. However, gene organization is also one of the levels to regulate the gene expression. In prokaryotes, clustering of r-protein genes is commonly observed as operons and superoperons (Ning et al. 2000). In eukaryotes, such coordinated expression is not seen but the distribution of genes tends to be non random, biased towards one or a few chromosomes (Barakat et al.2001,Yoshihama et al. 2002).

Second, as r-proteins have been found to be involved in certain extra ribosomal cellularfunctions (Wool1996)multiple on supplementary copies may fulfill the demand of such functions, without hampering the availability for the primary cause.

RESULTS: Maximum rice growth and yield were obtained in rice receiving the full recommended fertiliser rate in combination with the strain RS87. Interestingly, all rice cultivars which were treated with strain Rs87 and 50% recommended fertiliser rate provided equivalent plant growth and yield to that receiving the full recommended fertiliser rate only. A paired comparison between rice treated with 50% of the recommended fertiliser rate with the bacterial inoculant and the full fertiliser rate alone was further examined in small experimental rice paddy fields. Growth and yield of all rice cultivars which received the 50% fertiliser rate supplemented with strain Rs87 gave a similar yield to that receiving the full fertiliser rate alone. CONCLUSION: Bacterial strain RS87 showed the potential to replace 50% of the recommended fertiliser rate for yield production.

Confusion in nomenclature of Curvularia arose because a related genus, Bipolaris, has Cochliobolus as the in teleomorphic stage. However, in 2011, International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants (ICN) introduced one fungus, one name’ concept for naming of fungi species (McNeill and Turland 2011). Wijayawardene et al. (2014) conserved the anamorphic name, Curvularia over Cochliobolus because it was widely used by many researchers. Multi-gene analysis by Manamgoda et al. (2012) also proposed to take priority in naming Curvularia compared to sexual stage. Currently, Curvularia is classified into family Pleosporaceae under Dothidiomycetes fungi [Ariyawansa et al. (2015)]. The nomenclature of Bipolaris was taken priority over Cochliobolus because of the importance as economically phytopathogens (Rossman et al. 2013; Manamgoda et al. 2014). Curvularia species consist of saprophytes, endophytes and pathogens (Sanchez Marquez et al. 2008; Condon et al. 2014).

Several varieties have a long history of cultivation in China, India,and Thailand (Kong et al. 2008). In Thailand, purple riceis called“KaoKum-Ymmn”or“KaoNiawDam mu” where Kum means purple, Dam means black, Kao means rice, and Neow means glutinous grain type. Purple rice is mostly used in preparing desserts in Thailand, especially in the northern and northeastern regions of the country.In these re gions, each farmer traditionally grows purple rice in a very small portion (< 5%) of their rice cultiva- tion area. After harvest, purple rice is divided into two parts, one for use within the household and the other as the seed source for the next year's crop. Farmers usually cultivate at least one localpurple rice variety for consumption within the family for Hesserts and use in traditional ceremonies.

Cellulose mainly contributes to the strength of the rice husk due to its high elastic modulus of 40 to 130 GPa, and provides the rice husk with a high tendency to absorb moisture from the environment. Hemicellulose is a branched polysaccharide with large numbers of polar hydroxyl group. Due to the high silica content, the bulk of rice husk is burnt to produce ash which is a source for silicon compounds, especially silica. The rice husk ash obtained from combustion of rice husk usually contains greater than 70 wt% silica.) ",

Arsenic contamination of groundwater and soil is a major human health issue, particularly in South and Southeast Asia. Use of As-contaminated groundwater from shallow tubewells for irrigation of paddy rice, the staple food for people in this region, is one of the causes of As-related health impacts. The anaerobic growing conditions of flooded rice paddies and the unique physiology of the rice plants lead to increased As levels in rice. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set advisory levels of As in polished (i.e., white) rice grain at 0.2 mg/kg, but the EU and USA are yet to set legal standards for As in rice and rice-based products. Strategies for lowering As accumulation in rice revolve around two approaches—agronomic and biotechnological. Agronomic approaches, such as mineral supplementation of soil using iron, phosphorus, sulfur, silicon, water management, soil aeration practices, and the use of biological agents, are designed to lower As solubility, and uptake by rice. Rotation of the rice crop with As accumulating plants could also result in lowering soil As. Biotechnological approaches involve producing transgenic rice varieties by altering the expression of genes involved in As uptake, translocation, and sequestration in the plant. These approaches, combined with proper diet management and creating public awareness on potential health risks resulting from chronic exposure to As in rice, could play a key role in risk reduction.)

Elevated UV-B level was treated for 8h daily (8:00-16:00) excluding cloudy and rainy days. The UV-B radiation from the tubes was determined with a radiometer (BNU297, Beijing, China) and weighted with the generalized plant action spectrum (Caldwell, 1971) normalized to 300 nm to obtain the biologically effective UV-B radiation. The biologically weighted UV-B dosage was 14.4kJm-2 d-1. The dosage corresponded to approximately 25% stratospheric ozone depletion in Nanjing, China (32°3'N, 118°46'E, 8.9 m) using the model of Green (1983). In the treatment of ambient UV-B radiation, non-burning UV-B tubes were placed on the top of the frames to make shade, as in the elevated UV-B treatment. Thus, the visible light environment was similar under ambient and elevated UV-B radiations. Shading from the tubes, tube supports and frames was measured using a ceptometer (LP-80, Decagon, USA). On a clear day, with maximum shading (i.e. with low zenith angle), the canopy received about 90% of the PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) detected above the frames.) ",

    "input": "(During the period of rice cultivation, two peaks of CH4 fluxes occurred at tillering and jointing to booting stages, respectively (Fig. 2). At tillering stage with higher air temperature (Fig. 1), rapid growth of rice plants largely promoted root exudation because rice released photosynthates into the rhizosphere (rhizodeposition). Accordingly, CH4 fluxes peaked on 30 days after rice transplanting. Then, CH4 fluxes decreased and remained at low levels by the draining-drying flooded field to control ineffective tillering. Rhizodeposition was regarded as the main origin of CH4 evolved from rice fields (Kimura et al., 2004). With entering jointing and booting stages, more photosynthates were released into rhizosphere, which supplied more organic substrates for methanogenic bacteria, and thus CH4 fluxes peaked again on 51 days and 71 days for parent and transgenic rice, respectively. Apparently, difference in the occurrence date of the second peak of CH4 fluxes existed between the two rice cultivars, which is likely related to the differences in CH4 production, oxidation and transport capacities of different cultivars (Mitra et al., 1999; Lou et al., 2008), because physiological and morphological properties obviously differed between rice cultivars (Wu et al., 2007; Mohammed and Lee, 2011).)

The differences in the timing of the second peak between the two rice cultivars suggest variations in their CH4 production, oxidation, and transport capabilities, influenced by their distinct physiological and morphological properties.",

Differences in the contents of amylose and the fine structures of amylopectin were detected, however, which did correlate with texture. It appeared that the texture of the rices was critically controlled by the proportion of the longest (DP 92-98) and shortest (DP<25) amylopectin chains but not the intermediate (DP 43-68) chains. Hard cooking rice tended to have a higher amylose content (or amylose:amylopectin ratio) and more longer chain amylopectin than soft cooking rice, which feature is thought to encourage more extensive intra and/or inter molecular interactions with other components in rice grain, such as protein, lipid and non-starch polysaccharides and results in a firmer texture. The different amylopectin structures may explain why rices that possess similar amylose contents can have different textural properties. Such a correlation suggests that the structure of the starches determined from the SE-HPLC profile of the debranched amylopectin could be useful as a sensitive screening method in the classification of cooked rice texture.)

Proteins removed differences in the curves, suggesting that the changes to the peak viscosity in grains from different rates of N nutrition are due to protein. Figure 2 shows that as N nutrition increases, the peak height decreases, suggesting that the increase in protein content in line with the rate of N nutrition leads to a suite of proteins that contributes less to the viscosity curve.

Approximately 1 billion people worldwide suffer with this disease. When hypertension is undiagnosed or uncontrolled, it places patients at risk for other cardiovascular diseases, contributing to an increase in mortality and morbidity. Hypertension is closely associated with diet, but a diet rich in foods with anti-hypertensive activity can potentially prevent or reduce disease severity as a supplement to drug therapy. RPLKPW [4] is a potent anti-hypertensive peptide that was designed based on the structure of ovokinin(2-7) (RADHPF) [5], a vasorelaxing peptide derived from ovalbumin. Oral administration of RPLKPW at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg has been shown to lower the systolic blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). When RPLKPW sequences were introduced into three sites of the α subunit of soybean β-conglycinin by base substitution mutation, the modified protein lowered the systolic blood pressure of SHRs at a dose of 10 mg/kg [6]. Furthermore, for improvement of RPLKPW peptide release from fusion protein, modification of the peptide was attempted by addition of arginine (R) and glutamine (Q) residues to the amino and carboxy termini respectively. When these RRPLKPWQ sequences were introduced into the corresponding regions of the subunit, the modified protein reduced blood pressure at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg [7]. The result demonstrates that the addition of the R-Q spacer facilitates RPLKPW release in vivo by gastrointestinal proteases. While the systolic blood pressure in normotensive rats was not affected even by a high dose of RPLKPW peptide [5], which indicates that it may be an ideal functional peptide with anti-hypertensive activity, and is a candidate for further hypertensive remediation study.

Therefore, it is very significant to guarantee the rice quality. As our known, the quality of rice is different with geographical origin. The traditional methods in detecting food quality are based on the sensory and chemical analysis. According to the chemical composition of the food samples, it can provide much information, such as recognition of geographical origin, authenticity, and category differentiation. The sensory analysis is subjective and time-consuming, while the chemical analysis requires tedious chemical pretreatment and processing. N. Wang et al.

The main problem of rice production is the huge amount of loss from broken rice during the postharvest processes. Both the quality and market value of the broken rice are greatly reduced. Rice breakage is closely related to the rice fissure. The rice fissure may result from any one postharvest processing stage, which starts from the late maturing stage in the field, to the ensuing stages of rice harvesting, drying, storage and milling processes. Once fissure initiates in the rice kernel in each of these stages, this fissure will more likely grow in the next stage. And fissure will finally cause rice breakage in the milling process. An increased rice broken rate will lead to a reduced head rice yield. Thus rice producers regard head rice yield as one of their primary objectives, monitoring and controlling fissure initiation and growth is generally an important concern. A decrease in rice breakage means a decrease in loss. Therefore it is very important to propose a quickly and effectively evaluating way in which the rice mechanical properties can be related to rice breakage potentials.) ",

At seedling stage, rice and wheat were similarly sensitive to Al in both dose- and time-dependent manner during a 24-h Al exposure.

Such research efforts include development of so-called functional foods, foods that provide beneficial health or physiological effects aside from their nutritional value. Interest in the design and development of functional foods has stimulated discussion of concepts related to food biotechnology at the molecular, biochemical, cellular, and bioprocessing levels. For the past two decades, our laboratory has been involved in the improvement of soybean proteins through protein biotechnology.

In this case, water scarcity means <2.7 m³ of water per person per day (White,2012). Unless action is taken, the projected decrease in water availability and increasing demands from other sectors will severely impact irrigated agriculture and food production in the country. There is, therefore, an urgent need to manage water resources sustainably. This is also reflected in the Indian National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) and the National Water Mission (NWM) initiatives.) ",

It notes that India's per capita water availability is low and unevenly distributed, with projections showing a significant increase in water demand by 2025. The urgency to adopt sustainable water management practices is emphasized, aligning with national initiatives like the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture and the National Water Mission to mitigate the impact on agriculture and ensure food security.",

The survey consisted of 15 questions grouped into three parts: (1) respondents’ demographics, (2) adeptness in recognizing weedy rice and their management practices, and (3) CRT (Supplementary Appendix S1). In Part 1, the farmers were asked to fill in their sociodemographic information: age, education level, their experience in rice farming, their primary job, and field size. In Part 2, farmers were interviewed concerning their adeptness at recognizing weedy rice and what they do to manage weedy rice. Part 3 consisted of questions to document information on the implementation of CRT among farmers. Farmers were asked about the obstacles of adopting CRT, source of Clearfield rice seed and OnDutyTM herbicide, adherence to the use of OnDutyTM herbicide with Clearfield rice, knowledge on the application rate and timing of OnDutyTM in Clearfield rice fields, the number of seasons cultivating Clearfield rice consecutively, and the occurrence of weedy rice resistance to OnDutyTM herbicide. Before data collection, a pilot test was performed to determine the appropriateness of the questions, clarity, and likelihood of obtaining good quality data.

In this review various adaptive characters of the weed, which comprise the survival strategy, are discussed through the life cycle.The weed is distributed only in fooded rice. Seeds (spikelets) buried in the soil exhibit annual cycles between dormant and non-dormant state, and non-dormant seeds recurrently appear in spring when rice growers start to prepare seedling beds and fields for rice transplanting. The non-dormant seeds have unique characters metabolically adapted to submerged conditions to germinate and grow by the anaerobic respiration through alcohol fermentation. The weed has seemingly perfect mimicry of the rice plants throughout its development from seedling to heading, by which the weed escapes from manual weeding. In a rice paddy, the weed starts heading coincidentally with the rice plants at the period when the growers are reluctant to walk in the rice paddy to weed. Irrespective of plant height of the rice cultivar, the weed develops a few upper leaves above the rice canopy during the heading period of rice.This phenotypic plasticity of E. oryzicola in plant height is one of the characters conferring its competitive aggressiveness in fooded rice. When weeding is begun again after heading, the dormant weed seeds escape weeding by shattering and join the soil seedbank. The dormant seeds express the gene of an enzyme catalyzing ATP synthesis through the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation more abundantly, and have larger oxygen absorption and enzyme activity of the aerobic respiration than the non-dormant seeds, suggesting that the dormant seeds maintain viability by the con- ventional aerobic respiration in the paddy soil drained from rice harvesting in fall to the next early spring.

Phytohormone is an important compound regulating specific plant growth. Auxin and cytokines can be obtained in the form of synthetic compounds or produced by organisms and used to increase crop production. Various types of plant growth-promoting bacteria produce various types of phytohormone. Indole-3-Acetic Acid is a key hormone for many aspects of plant growth that can regulate many physiological processes. The objective of the study was to obtain IAA (auxin) producing bacteria and its application on rice growth. Nineteenth isolates from Biogen Culture Collection were screened indolic compound production by spectrophotometer. Moreover, all isolates were selected in greenhouse to monitor the effect of bacterial application on the growth of rice plant. After that, all isolates were identified based on 16S rRNA Theresult of quantitative analysis of IAA production from 17 bacterial isolates showed that Enterobacter ludwigii FB Endo 135 produced the highest IAA (43.8 mg ·L-'), while the smallest IAA concentration produced by Azm 1.7.2.12 (7.63 mg · L-').

The addition of L-tryptophan into bacterial culture medium can increase the biosynthesis of IAA up to 2.7 times. L-tryptophan is an amino acid with an indole group that can function as a physiological precursor of IAA in plants and microorganisms because it contains active compounds that can trigger microbial growth. In soil microorganisms, IAA biosynthesis can be triggered by the presence of L-tryptophan derived from root exudates. The higher the concentration of tryptophan given, the higher the level of IAA production. Certain bacteria are capable of producing a tryptophanase enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of the indole group from tryptophan. In the culture medium, the indole accumulates as the waste material, while the other part of the tryptophan molecule such as pyruvic acid can be used as a source of energy through the citric acid cycle, while ammonium (NH4') can be used to meet the nutrient requirements of microorganisms. Tryptophan is converted to IAA by bacteria through four paths, i.e., Indole-3-acetamide (IAM), Indole-3-pyruvate (IpyA), Tryptamine (TAM), and Indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN) pathways.

X-ray patterns results showed that the crystalline structure of crandallite was disorganized when it was heated up to temperatures ranging from 450 to 700°C and new mineral phases were formed under higher temperatures, that is phosphocristobalite and whitlockite.

Rice crops constitute 11% of the total arable area in the world and they are distributed in 122 countries in all continents. Rice cultivation requires a lot of water. Therefore, the warm and humid weather of Southeast Asia is particularly favorable. The most fertile lands are located in plains, along rivers, and in areas rich of silt, such as Mekong Delta, in Vietnam. All the countries that are great rice producers need accurate and time-effective updated information about the conditions of rice fields and their growth. Conventional ground-based monitoring undertaken by farmers or specialists provides very accurate information but the monitoring is very expensive; it does not allow covering large areas and it is difficult to be routinely implemented. Within this context, remote sensing is of paramount importance since it ensures a synoptic and cost-effective monitoring.) ",

Due to environmental concerns, utilization options and examination of pollution emissions from open field burning have been the principal areas of investigation of rice straw. Nowadays, several alternative uses and disposal mechanisms for rice straw have been proposed which can be divided into two categories: (1) offsite use of rice straw or (2) onsite disposal. However, in most cases incorporation of rice straw into the soil has proved undesirable because of the large amount of material, slow degradation and excessive cost.

Rice plants were inoculated with each of three arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), Glomus versiforme (GV), Glomus mosseae (GM), and Glomus diaphanum (GD), or remained noninoculated (NM). Both rice cultivars could be colonized by the three AMF used in this experiment. The percentage of mycorrhizal colonization by the three AMFs on the two rice cultivars ranged from 30% to 70%. Mycorrhizal colonization of both upland rice cultivars had a large influence on plant growth by increasing the shoot and root biomass compared with non-inoculated (NM) plants. The results indicate that mycorrhiza exert some protective effects against the combined toxicity of Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd in the contaminated soil. This conclusion is supported by the partitioning of heavy metals (HMs) in the two cultivars. In the two cultivars, colonization by AMF reduced the translocation of HMs from root to shoot (except that the colonization of AMF increased the Cu translocation of HMs in cultivar “277”). Immobilization of the HMs in roots can alleviate the potential toxicity to shoots induced by the mixture of Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd.

    "input": "(Zinc (Zn) is one of the essential micronutrients for plants especially for rice growing under submerged conditions. Rice is the staple food for more than half of the world population. On a global basis, rice provides 21% and 15% per capita of dietary energy and protein, respectively (Maclean et al.2002). Rice is a major food crop in India especially in west Bengal. The concentration of the most of the nutrient elements in soil increases on submergence, but the availability of Zn to plant decreases. In submerged condition there is a formation of large amounts of Fe²+ and Mn2+ due to reduction of its higher valent oxides. As some of the reduced Fe diffuses to more oxic regions of the soils, it gets oxidized, leading to its precipitation as Fe3 (OH)s (hydrated magnetite) and Zn?+ gets adsorbed on the hydrous oxides of iron and hence Zn availability to plant decreases (Mandal et al.1993; Singh et al. 1999). Multiple cropping coupled with the use of high analysis (zinc-free) fertilizers have depleted the soil Zn. Globally Zn deficiency is the most widespread micronutrient disorder among different crops (Westfall et al. 1971; Romheld & Marschner 1991). On an average 50% of the Indian soils are deficient in Zn (Singh & Abrol 1986). The deficiency of this micronutrient frequently occurs in rice which is very sensitive to low Zn supply in submerged rice soils (Hazra et al.1987). Its occurrence has increased with the introduction of modern varieties, crop intensification and increased Zn removal. Zn deficiencies result in the inability of the rice plant to support root respiration during flooded conditions (Slaton et al. 2001). Typical Zn rice tissue levels are between 25 and 100 ppm with deficiency symptoms appearing when levels fall below 20 ppm (Takkar 1991). Zn plays key role in different plant metabolism processes like the development of cell walls, respiration, carbohydrate metabolism and gene expression and its regulation (Klug & Rhodes 1987). When the supply of Zn to the plant is inadequate, i.e. there is a deficiency of Zn, one or more of the many important physiological functions of Zn is unable to operate normally and the growth of the plant is adversely affected.)

Meanwhile, the overexpression of AtWRi1 increased starch content in endosperm. These results provide a new insight into the function of AtWRll in monocot and make a previous basement for the study of the connection of fatty acids and starch synthesis in rice.) ",

There have been reports on the sink-source traits contributing to high grain yield for single- and early-season rice, but such information is limited for late-season rice. In this study, field experiments were conducted at the research farm of Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi Province, China in the late rice-growing season. Grain yield and sink-source traits were compared among five cultivars (Guiliangyou 2, Teyou 838, Y-liangyou 087, Teyou 582, and Yuxiangyouzhan) in 2012 and then three cultivars (Guiliangyou 2, Teyou 838, and Y-liangyou 087) in 2013. Y-liangyou 087 produced 6-26% higher grain yield than did the other cultivars. This higher grain yield was driven by improvements in sink-source capacity. Sink capacity was 8-31% higher in Y-liangyou 087 than in the other cultivars. Well-balanced relations between spikelets m-2 and grain weight was responsible for the higher sink capacity in Y-liangyou 087. The result was that Y-liangyou 087 produced 11-17% greater biomass (source capacity) than did the other cultivars. The greater source capacity in Y-liangyou 087 was mainly attributed to higher radiation use efficiency (RUE).

Sink capacity is a function of the number of spikelets per unit land area and their potential size. Although it is generally considered that the number of spikelets per unit land area is the primary determinant of rice yield, there have been studies showing that increasing the spikelet size (grain weight) is a feasible approach to achieving high rice yield. Source capacity is usually expressed as the amount of biomass production, which is achieved through the plant's photosynthesis capacities. Biomass production is a product of the amount of radiation intercepted by the canopy and radiation use efficiency (RUE, i.e., biomass produced per unit of radiation intercepted). The former depends on incident radiation and intercepted percent (i.e., the fraction of incident radiation intercepted by the canopy). In fact, because the current durations coincide with suitable seasons that allow multiple cropping in a year, there is little interest in prolonging growth duration. Because most high-yielding cultivars are close to the optimum canopy architecture, it is difficult to improve canopy morphology. Consequently, there have reports that modifications to RUE are likely to be more important for achieving a substantial increase in rice yield.) ",

We assessed pollination (numbers of total and germinated pollen grains on the stigma) and morphology of dehisced anthers. Inclination significantly affected the number of total and germinated pollen grains on the stigma: as it increased from 0° to 45°, the percentage of florets with <20 total pollen grains on the stigma (TP20) increased from 36.6% to 59.9%, and that of florets with <10 germinated pollen grains on the stigma (GP10) increased from 26.6% to 58.9%. Both an increase in TP20 and a decrease in the rate of pollen germination were major causes of the increase in GP10. Inclination did not affect anther morphology.

The NBS-LRR domain is a typical domain of resistance genes and plays an important role in the defense against microbial invasion. In addition, serine threonine protein kinase plays an important role in disease resistance in rice. For example, OsPBL plays an important role in defense response mainly by promoting the salicylic acid-dependent pathway to resist pathogen infection. Cytochrome P450 family proteins are also involved in rice's pathogenic resistance. For example, CYP71Z2 is a P450 gene that enhances the resistance of rice to pathogenic bacteria by regulating phytoalexin synthesis.) ",

The increasing heavy-metal content of farmland soil due to the discharge of industrial waste, municipal sewage, and municipal waste, as well as the improper use of pesticides and fertilizers containing heavy metals may affect the quality and safety of rice products in the country (Wang and others 2007). The elements arsenic, mercury, lead, and cadmium are heavy metals that are highly toxic to humans. Cadmium, which has a biological half-life of 10 to 35 y, also easily accumulates in the body. The United States toxicant management committee has listed it as the 6th most hazardous element to humans (Cui and others 2006; Du and others 2013). Heavy metals in rice are combined with its main chemical constituents. Cd in rice has been found to be mainly associated with cereal components that form complexes (Mo and others 2002). The dominant form of cadmium is bound to proteins, mainly to glutenin and globulin (Kaneta and others 1986; Suzuki and others 1997; Yang and others 1999). Using tissue chemistry and solvent extraction methods, Yu and others (2010) studied the forms of cadmium in brown rice with low amounts of accumulated cadmium. Their results show that cadmium in brown rice exists mainly in the form of complexes with the proteins glutelin and globulin. According to the report of Kong and others (1988), heavy metals in rice are mainly associated with protein. Although concentrations of cadmium gradually decrease from embryo (0.16 mg/kg), which is rich in protein, to endosperm (0.04 mg/kg), which consists mainly of starch, its absolute amount in the embryo is only about 17%, whereas in endosperm, it accounts for about 70% (Zha and others 2000). Therefore, effective removal of heavy metals must not only include the embryo and address protein binding of heavy metals, but, more importantly, it must include the endosperm.) ",

Both morphological and electrophoretic characters were used to confirm the existence of hybrids. A total of 12,000 seeds were collected from red rice plants from fields of six different rice cultivars and sown in a common garden. Hybrids were generally taller and had longer, wider flag leaves than either red rice or cultivated rice. In addition, hybrids produced more tillers than red rice. Overall, hybrids were vegetatively robust plants, demonstrating heterosis and expressing morphological characteristics of both parents. That these plants were hybrids was confirmed by the existence of electrophoretic banding patterns common to both synthetic and natural hybrids.) ",

When hybridization occurs, gene flow is mainly in one direction, from the cultivated species into the weedy populations.

Low levels of gene flow have been shown for corn populations as well (Doebley et al., 1987). The unidirectionality of gene flow is typically due to the elimination of pistillate contributions by the cultivated species with the harvest of the crop. Thus, the primary transfer of genetic material is through pollen donation by the cultivated species into the weedy populations (Ladizinsky, 1985).) ",

    "input": "(Iron (Fe) is an essential trace element in plants. It is particularly required for the synthesis of chlorophyll. Under Fe-deficient conditions, chlorosis occurs in young leaves. Rice is grown under anaerobic conditions that induce a high Fe²+ concentration in the soil solution via the reduction of Fe³+, whereas barley is grown under aerobic conditions that induce a low Fe concentration in the soil solution due to the oxidation of Fe²+. Thus, barley has acquired a strong tolerance to Fe deficiency. Mugineic acid (MA) was first identified as a high-affinity Fe chelator called “phytosiderophore (PS)' in barley (Takagi et al. 1976; Mori 2001). The “Strategy II' plants, which include graminaceous plants, excrete PS and absorb the Fe³+-PS conjugate via a specific transporter on their plasma membrane (Romheld and Marschner 1986; Marschner 1995a; Curie et al. 2001). It is generally recognized that the tolerance of Strategy II plants to Fe deficiency is well correlated with the amount of MAs secreted from the roots (Takagi et al. 1976; Marschner 1995b). In fact, the amount of MAs secreted from barley roots is higher than that secreted from rice roots (Mori et al. 1991). On the other hand, there are few reports on the quantitative comparison of the patterns of iron-deficiency symptoms and the Fe contents between barley and rice, although it is generally known that not only the degree and also the pattern of Fe-deficiency symptoms in barley differ from those in rice. Although the mechanisms of Fe absorption via the roots have been well clarified at the molecular biology level (Schmidt 2003), experimental evidence of Fe translocation and utilization in shoots is limited and not systematic. It is generally agreed that Fe is oxidized when released into the xylem vessels and is then transported as a ferric Fe-citrate complex (Hell and Stephan 2003). It has also been reported that the absorption of iron in chloroplasts is a light-dependent process in barley (Bughio et al. 1997). Although several cellular organic acids and amino acids have the ability to form chelates with Fe, nicotianamine (NA) appears to play an important role in the long-distance transport of Fe (Hell and Stephan 2003). Recent research has also focused on the role of nitric oxide in the Fe metabolism (Graziano and Lamattina 2005). However, the mechanisms of Fe availability in shoots have not been fully elucidated.)

    "input": "(Iron (Fe) is an essential trace element in plants. It is particularly required for the synthesis of chlorophyll. Under Fe-deficient conditions, chlorosis occurs in young leaves. Rice is grown under anaerobic conditions that induce a high Fe²+ concentration in the soil solution via the reduction of Fe³+, whereas barley is grown under aerobic conditions that induce a low Fe concentration in the soil solution due to the oxidation of Fe²+. Thus, barley has acquired a strong tolerance to Fe deficiency. Mugineic acid (MA) was first identified as a high-affinity Fe chelator called “phytosiderophore (PS)' in barley (Takagi et al. 1976; Mori 2001). The “Strategy II' plants, which include graminaceous plants, excrete PS and absorb the Fe³+-PS conjugate via a specific transporter on their plasma membrane (Romheld and Marschner 1986; Marschner 1995a; Curie et al. 2001). It is generally recognized that the tolerance of Strategy II plants to Fe deficiency is well correlated with the amount of MAs secreted from the roots (Takagi et al. 1976; Marschner 1995b). In fact, the amount of MAs secreted from barley roots is higher than that secreted from rice roots (Mori et al. 1991). On the other hand, there are few reports on the quantitative comparison of the patterns of iron-deficiency symptoms and the Fe contents between barley and rice, although it is generally known that not only the degree and also the pattern of Fe-deficiency symptoms in barley differ from those in rice. Although the mechanisms of Fe absorption via the roots have been well clarified at the molecular biology level (Schmidt 2003), experimental evidence of Fe translocation and utilization in shoots is limited and not systematic. It is generally agreed that Fe is oxidized when released into the xylem vessels and is then transported as a ferric Fe-citrate complex (Hell and Stephan 2003). It has also been reported that the absorption of iron in chloroplasts is a light-dependent process in barley (Bughio et al. 1997). Although several cellular organic acids and amino acids have the ability to form chelates with Fe, nicotianamine (NA) appears to play an important role in the long-distance transport of Fe (Hell and Stephan 2003). Recent research has also focused on the role of nitric oxide in the Fe metabolism (Graziano and Lamattina 2005). However, the mechanisms of Fe availability in shoots have not been fully elucidated.)

    "input": "(Green manuring is a widely recognized cultural practice for increasing crop production (Biederbeck et al. 1998: Thonnissen et al. 2000). Among the different effects of organic amendment, nutrient supply is generally considered as the major factor; and this is particularly true for flooded rice, where green manuring is an established method of supplementing N availability (Ghai et al. 1988: De Datta and Buresh 1989; Aulakh et al. 2000a). Although the N-supplying potential of green manures undoubtedly accounts for much of the yield response, studies under upland conditions provide some evidence that green manures may also elicit yield responses through mechanisms other than improved N fertility, i.e., non-nutritional benefits (Bruulsema and Christie 1987; Smith et al. 1987). With lowland rice, many studies indicate that the N-supplying potential of green manures is limited and that the rice crop can make use of 10-50% of the N applied (Morris et al. 1989; Becker et al. 1991; Diekman et al. 1993). Therefore, there is also an opinion that green manuring enhances the overall and long-term fertility of the soil rather than serving as a major source of plant nutrients for the current crop (Ladd et al. 1983; Palm and Sanchez 1991; Ventura and Watanabe 1993). Leguminous plant materials are also known to increase the mineralization of native soil N, which might be an important mechanism through which green manures enhance soil productivity (Fox et al. 1990; Azam et al. 1993; Hood 2001). In rice, both inorganic fertilizers and green manures are known to increase the plant availability of soil N through the added nitrogen interaction (ANI; Diekman et al. 1993). Besides, plant residues incorporated into flooded soils have been reported to significantly enhance associative N2 fixation (Rao 1978; Roper 1985). Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that increasing the organic matter content of flooded rice soils might enhance the N supply to rice plants.) ",

Only the shoot material from sesbania and maize was used as an organic amendment and their application rate was adjusted so that the soil received an almost equal amount of 6 N HCl-hydrolyzable N (i.e., 23.4 mg N kg soil for sesbania, 23.9 mg N kg soil for maize). The powdered plant residues were mixed with the soil before transplanting the rice, whereas the inorganic N fertilizer was applied in solution in two equal splits, one each at transplanting and at tillering.

    "input": "(In both rice cultivars, the N-supplying potential of the organic sources was equivalent to 150-200 mg N pot off the inorganic N (Table 5). However, in both rice cultivars, almost twice as much N was taken up from the inorganic source applied at 300 mg pot', as compared with that from the two organic sources. In both rice cultivars, the two types of plant residues supplied similar amounts of N (i.e., NdfAS, by the isotopic dilution method; Table 5). The plant N recovery calculated by the difference method generally gave higher values, which indicates the priming effect or ANI. Of the two rice cultivars, IR-6 was relatively more efficient in utilizing the applied N. The recovery efficiency of N uptake from the applied sources (%ANU; Table 5) was well within the range reported by others (Koyama et al. 1973; Prasad and De Datta 1979). Similar to other reports (Fox et al. 1990; Torbert et al. 1992; Azam et al. 1993), the difference method gave higher values for %ANU than the isotopic method, but the two methods were significantly correlated (r=0.586, P<0.05). The data in Table 5 further reveal that the greater effects of sesbania than maize residues on the rice dry matter yield and N uptake were related more to the differences in the uptake of unlabeled N from soil than to the N-supplying potential of the residues. The two types of plant residues showed marked differences in affecting the content of unlabeled plant N (Ndfs). Under both rice cultivars, leguminous compared with non-leguminous residues had a substantially positive effect on the uptake of unlabelled N (presumably derived from mineralization of the native organic N of soil, or through associative N2 fixation), whereas maize residues had a negligible effect. Inorganic N also exerted a positive effect on the unlabeled N content of the plants, the effect increasing with increasing N application rate. The effect of different treatments on the plant availability of the unlabeled N was also exhibited in terms of ANI, which was higher in soil amended with sesbania than with maize residues. In both rice cultivars, a substantial ANI was also observed due to inorganic N application; and this was most pronounced at the highest N application rate (300 mg N pot'). In IR-6, the ANI due to sesbania was twice as much as the inorganic N applied at 300 mg pot, but in Bas-370, the two treatments showed a comparable ANI. The occurrence of ANI in soils treated with inorganic and organic N sources has been reported, both in laboratory incubation and in plant growth experiments (Jenkinson et al. 1985; Hart et al. 1986; Woods et al. 1987; Chalk et al. 1990; Azam et al. 1993). In rice also, ANI following incorporation of leguminous plant residues has been reported (Diekman et al. 1993) Our results suggest that such an effect depends on the chemical composition of the plant residues; and those with a narrow C/N ratio (like sesbania) have a greater beneficial effect. In contrast, plant residues with a wider C/N ratio (like maize), which need to be applied in much higher amounts in order to meet crop N demands, may even cause a negative effect on the net mineralization of soil N and thus its availability to plants. In the present study, the amount of N applied as organic matter had more positive effects on the dry matter accumulation and N yield of rice, as compared with inorganic N applied at equivalent rates. Similar results have been obtained by others (Westcott and Mikkelsen 1985) and could be attributed to the additional effects of green manures on soil productivity. Comparing the two sources of organic matter, sesbania was more effective, whereas an even much higher amount of organic matter added as maize residues had a rather negative effect on the growth of rice and its N uptake, particularly in the cultivar IR-6. Since the N availability from the two organic sources was almost similar, the lower availability of soil N due to maize compared to sesbania amendment may partly be due to its immobilization and/or denitrification loss, since both these processes are stimulated by soluble C and much higher C was added as maize compared with sesbania residues. Our contention is partly supported by the N loss data (Table 5), which were almost twice as high under maize compared with sesbania amendments. The much higher C inputs in maize compared with sesbania treatment (besides increasing the losses from the applied N) might also have increased both the immobilization and the denitrification of mineral N originating from the native soil N pool. Nevertheless, even higher amounts of the applied N were unaccounted for in treatments receiving (NH4)2SO4, particularly at higher application rates; and this was most probably due to NH3 volatilization and/or denitrification. In lowland rice, sesbania green manuring compared with urea application alone is reported to decrease the floodwater pH and thus reduce NH3 volatilization (Diekman et al. 1993). The present experiment was conducted for only one growing season; and a comparison of the long-term effects of the two green manures is. therefore, beyond the scope of our study. In the present study, only the shoot material of sesbania was used as an organic amendment, whereas the root component also had substantial dry matter (3.3 g pot-) and N content (78.0 mg pot'). Besides, the amount of N supplied in sesbania residues (30 mg kg-′ soil) was fairly low, as compared with the amounts of mineral fertilizers generally used for flooded rice fields (120-180 kg N ha-1) However, even at the low N application rate, the grain yields of both cultivars were similar in treatments receiving sesbania-N (30 mg kg-1) and (NH4)2SO4-N as -300 treatment (60 mg kg-, almost equivalent to the optimum N rates). These two treatments also showed comparable N yields for Bas-370, whereas IR-6 showed slightly lower N yields with sesbania-N than with (NH4)2SO4-N as -300 treatment. Therefore, under field conditions, where both roots and shoots are incorporated, the overall beneficial effects of leguminous green manures like sesbania might be further enhanced by optimizing the inputs. The results of the present study imply that leguminous green manures not only serve as a direct source of plant- available N, they also have a great potential for increasing the availability of soil N to crop plants and for conserving N. Regarding these beneficial effects, leguminous green manures are superior to non-leguminous manures applied at equivalent N rates and to mineral fertilizers applied at equivalent or even higher N rates.) ",
    "output": "This extensive passage discusses the comparative effects of sesbania and maize as green manures on the growth and nitrogen uptake of rice cultivars IR-6 and Bas-370. The study found that sesbania, a leguminous green manure, was more effective than maize in enhancing rice growth and nitrogen uptake, primarily due to its better influence on the uptake of unlabeled nitrogen from the soil. The added nitrogen interaction (ANI) was more pronounced with sesbania, indicating its superior ability to enhance soil nitrogen availability compared to maize and inorganic nitrogen sources. The study also highlights that the chemical composition of green manures, particularly the C/N ratio, plays a crucial role in their effectiveness, with narrower C/N ratios (like that of sesbania) being more beneficial. The findings suggest that leguminous green manures can be more advantageous than non-leguminous ones and even inorganic fertilizers in terms of enhancing soil productivity and nitrogen conservation.",

In 2003, research was conducted to investigate the presence of DNA of transgenic plants in rumen, duodenum, milk, feces and blood of lactating beef fed with soybean meal and transgenic maize seeds [37]. The results showed that transgenic genes (cp4epseps and cryla(b)) is found only in the rumen and duodenum but has not been found in any of the blood samples found to be consistent with the results of research conducted by Einspanier et al.

According to researchers, the cause of the absence of DNA components in stool samples may be due to the destruction of DNA in the gastrointestinal tract so that only small pieces are present, which contradicts the results of the study by Einspanier et al.

In fact, the discovery of any plant DNA in the stool is likely to be affected by a number of factors, including the dietary form (e.g., whole grain or processed feed), or the amount of DNA replication that sometimes results from a small number that replicating parts cannot recognize it [37]. Nemeth et al. (2004) [39] was conducted on broiler chickens, steering cattle, milk cows, and pigs fed with transgenic corn (MON810). They showed that the gene of Rubisco (rbcl) present in muscle samples of steering cattle, broiler chickens and pigs, as well as in milk in cattle, but it was not found in the liver.

The studies consistently show that while transgenic DNA can be detected in some parts of the gastrointestinal tract (like the rumen and duodenum), it is generally absent in other tissues such as blood, liver, and muscle. This suggests that transgenic DNA is likely degraded in the gastrointestinal tract, and only small, undetectable fragments may pass further into the body. The findings from these studies, including the absence of the P35 gene in any tissue, support the conclusion that transgenic components from GM foods do not significantly integrate into animal tissues, aligning with the results of the study on rats fed GM rice, which also found no significant presence of transgenic genes in the liver.",

Distinct morphological differences are observed between cultivated forms and their wild ancestors. The investigation of such domestication related traits shed light on the clarification how the ancient humans modified the wild plants for our life. Several studies have been reported to identify the genes or mutations underlying the domestication events using molecular techniques and genome information (reviewed in Glémin and Bataillon, 2009; Purugganan and Fuller, 2009; Sang, 2009). One of the striking characters specific for the cultivated forms is loss of seed shattering (Harlan, 1975). Originally, wild seed-shattering behavior at maturation stage guarantees the success of propagation through seed dispersal. This character, however, is undesirable for the ancient seed gatherers because of the difficulty of seed collection. Therefore, the reduction of seed-shattering degree was considered to be required in the early phase of domestication (Fuller, 2007).) ",

CoQ plays an indispensable role as a component of the respiratory chain in mitochondria, and the reduced form of CoQ shows strong anti-oxidation ability. CoQ consists of an isoprenoid side chain and a benzoquinone frame; the length of the side chain varies naturally depending on the organism (Kawamukai 2002). For example, humans produce mainly CoQ10, which has 10 isoprene units, whereas most cereal crops produce mainly CoQ9, which has 9 isoprene units (Kamei et al. 1986). CoQ10 has been commercially sold as a food supplement and a cosmetic. The CoQ biosynthesis pathway has been intensively studied in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The major part of CoQ biosynthesis begins with the transfer off the isoprenoid side chain to the benzoquinone frame, and the length of the side chain of CoQ is determined by polyprenyl diphosphate synthase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of a given length of isoprenoid chain (Kawamukai 2002). Most of CoQ biosynthetic pathway in plants remains unclear Because genes homologous to those engaged in yeast CoQ biosynthesis have been found in Arabidopsis (Kawamukai 2002), the pathway in plant is presumed to be similar to that of yeast.

In this study, we developed a new small-scale CoQ extraction method which requires only 10- to 20-mg samples (corresponding to a single rice seed), so that we could measure the CoQ content of a single T seed in which ddsA gene was carried as homo, hemi or null. Comparison of the old and the new CoQ extraction method is shown in Table 1. In CoQ extraction from 100-mg of Nipponbare seed by the old method, the recovery rate of CoQ6 (internal control) was 61.9±7.2% (Table 1, experiment #1). As a control experiment, when CoQ was extracted from the same sample by the old method without pre-treatment steps (the ‘old-pre’ method), the recovery rate of CoQ6 was nearly 100%(Table 1,experiment #2), suggesting degradation of CoQ6 during pre-treatment steps. If the recovery rate of CoQ6 in experiment #1 was as- sumed to be 100%,the CoQ9 content was calculated to be 5.2±0.0μg/g, which was much higher than the CoQ9 con- tent from the old-pre method (Table 1, experiment #1 in parenthesis vs. #2). This result suggests that CoQ9 included in the samples was rather effectively extracted than degrad- ed during the pre-treatment steps of the old method, and the CoQ9 (andprobablyCoQ10) content obtainedfromexperi- ment #1 was overestimated. Because we used the old CoQ extraction method in our previous paper, we speculate that the CoQ contents reported there were overestimated.In CoQ extraction from100-mg of N-S14:ddsA seed by the old method, the recovery rate of CoQ6 was 97.7±1.9% (Table 1, experiment #5), showing a large (over 30%) variation in the recovery rate of CoQ6 depend on sample in extraction by the old method.

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants affected by RTD show stunted growth, yellow to orange leaf discoloration, and few reproductive tillers (Thomas et al. 1980). RTD is caused by Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) and Rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV). Both RTSV and RTBV are transmitted by green leafhoppers (GLH) in a semi-persistent manner (Hibino et al. 1991). RTSV is independently transmitted by GLH, whereas RTBV can be transmitted by GLH only in the presence of RTSV (Hibino et al. 1990). An evaluation of more than 40,000 rice germplasm accessions for RTSV and RTBV showed that dozens of traditional cultivars are resistant to RTSV, whereas only two cultivars are resistant to RTBV (Hibino et al. 1990, Shahjahan et al.1990,Zenna et al.2006). A genetic analysis of RTD-resistant rice cultivar Utri Merah showed that RTSV and RTBV resistance are independently inherited, and the interaction between both resistance traits is necessary to suppress RTD effectively (Encabo et al. 2009). RTSV resistance is a recessive trait controlled by the translation initiation factor 4 gamma (eIF4G) gene located between 22.05 and 22.25 Mb in chromosome 7 (Lee et al. 2010).

Four treatments were studied in a long-term field experiment (1998-2015): continuous flooding (CF), flooding—midseason drying—flooding (F-D-F), flooding—midseason drying—intermittent irrigation without obvious standing water (F-D-S), and flooding——rain-fed (F-RF). The average precipitation was 483 mm in early-rice season and 397 mm in late-rice season. The irrigated water for CF, F-D-F, F-D-S, and F-RF, respectively, was 263, 340, 279, and 170 mm in early-rice season, and 484, 528, 422, and 206 mm in late-rice season. Grain yield for CF, F-D-F, F-D-S, and F-RF, respectively, was 4,722, 4,597, 4,479, and 4,232 kg/ha in early-rice season, and 5,420, 5,402, 5,366, and 4,498 kg/ha in late-rice season. Compared with CF, F-D-F consumed more irrigated water, which still decreased grain yield, leading to a decrease in water productivity by 25% in early-rice season and by 8% in late-rice season. Compared with F-D-F, F-D-S saved much irrigated water with a small yield reduction, leading to an increase in water productivity by 22% in early-rice season and by 26% in late-rice season. The results indicate that CF is best for early-rice and FDS is best for late-rice in terms of grain yield and water productivity.) ",

This study evaluated transplanting date and nitrogen (N) fertilizer rate in the management to improve rice productivity. The effect of transplanting date and N fertilizer rate on rice productivity was analyzed by investigating rice growth, and also by dividing rainfed rice fields located in a mini-watershed into 4 subecosystems: (1) medium deep water, waterlogged (MDW), (2) shallow water, favorable (SWf), (3) shallow water, drought- and submergence-prone (SWds), and (4) shallow water, drought-prone (SWd). Rice grew at almost a constant rate until maturity and the growth rate was higher at a lower field. The difference in productivity was derived from not only a water condition but also soil fertility, and was associated with the rate of N uptake. Small leaf area index was found to be one of the causes for low productivity in rice. Statistic analysis showed that earlier transplanting increased biomass production in all subecosystems. The biomass-increase resulted in a higher yield in SWds and SWd fields while it resulted in a reduced harvest index (HI) and did not increase yield in MDW and SWf fields. The effect of N fertilizer was apparent in the field where rice biomass was small due to later transplanting or unfertile soil, but the effect was generally small.

    "input": "(Since the late 1980's as a result of over production of rice in Japan, rice breeding has focused on new grain types to diversify rice processing and use. Amylose content in starch deposited in rice endosperm is closely related to cooking and eating quality of rice and varies depending on genotypes and environmental factors. Lower amylose content is related to the stickiness of cooked rice and East Asian people prefer stickier rice than people from South Asia. A gene, du, lowering amylose content was screened from induced mutant stocks (Okuno et al.,1983) and used as a gene source in rice breeding programs throughout Japan. Two different genes, du and Wx alleles, have been used to broaden the genetic variation of amylose content. The function of the wx locus is structurally for starch granule-bound glucosyltransferase that is responsible for amylose synthesis; whereas du genes regulate gene expression of the non-waxy allele at the wx locus. Since the first release of a low amylose variety in 1991, 17 new low amylose varieties have been developed. Amylose content is dramatically affected by temperature during the early grain filling period, especially 20 days after flowering, suggesting that the expression of du and Wx alleles are sensitive to temperatures during the grain filling period from anthesis to 20 days after flowering (Asaoka et al., 1989, Okuno et al., 1993). Since the response of du and Wx alleles are sensitive to temperature during the grain-filling period, growing location is a key factor in selecting the most suitable genes to lower amylose content. For uniform rice quality it is necessary to grow rice adapted to different temperature conditions. Five du loci have been identified (Yano et al., 1988) and choosing allelic combinations at the wx locus and du loci can provide varieties that produce a range of variation in amylose content in rice endosperms.)

    "input": "(Wheat Low amylose and glutinous (waxy) wheat varieties are expected to meet new demands from consumers and the flour industry. The major portion of wheat flour is storage starch consisting of 75% amylopectin and 25% amylose. Amylose content affects the glutinosity of Japanese udon noodles. Glutinosity is a key factor in the palatability or textural quality of Japanese noodles in which some degree of stickiness is desirable. The level of Wx protein bound to starch granules is correlated to the amylose content. A modified SDS-PAGE can separate the wheat Wx proteins into two bands, a high molecular weight band consisting of the Wx-Al protein and a low molecular weight band comprising two proteins, Wx-Bl and Wx-D1 (Nakamura et al., 1992). The geographical distribution of nulls for Wx-Al, Bl and D1 proteins was determined in 2,000 wheat accessions (Yamamori et al., 1994). Gel electrophoretic analysis revealed that the null allele for the Wx-Al protein occurred frequently in Korean, Japanese and Turkish varieties. About 48% of varieties from Australia and India were deficient for the Wx-Bl protein. Only one Chinese variety lacked the Wx-D1 protein. While 9 Japanese varieties were deficient in both the Wx-Al and Wx-B1 proteins, no varieties lacked both the Wx-Al and Wx-D1 proteins, both the Wx-Bl and Wx-Dl proteins or all the three Wx proteins. On the basis of the presence or absence of three Wx proteins, wheat varieties can be classified into 8 types with different amylose content (Table 1)(Nakamura et al., 2002). Compared with 28.7% in Type 1 with three Wx proteins, the amylose content in Type 3 (deficient in Wx-B1), 5 (deficient in Wx-B1 and Wx-D1),6 (deficient in Wx-Al and Wx-D1) and 7 (deficient in Wx-Al and Wx-B1) significantly decreased to 19.8-27.1%. Type 8 (waxy or glutinous wheat) lacking all the three Wx proteins was not detected through evaluation of wheat germplasm collections. A Chinese variety, Bai Huo, was found lacking the Wx-D1 protein and this made it possible to breed waxy or glutinous phenotype in cross combination with type 7 varieties which lacks Wx-Al and Wx-Bl proteins. Wx-B1 protein has a greater effect on decreasing amylose content in wheat endosperm starch than Wx-Al and Wx-Dlproteins. About 40% of the Australian wheats carried the null allele Wx-Blb.The Australian Standard White (AsW)， which is awheat brand,composed of severalAustralian varieties,showedaloweramylosecontentofflourand better glutinosity for noodles than standard Japanese wheat varieties.Since the null alleleWx-Blb seems to lower amylose content, it could be also responsible for the low amylose of AsW.Twowheat varieties suitable for Japanese noodles,Kanto 79 (22.3% of amylose content) and Kanto 107(21.6%),have been released and lackWx-Al(Wx-A1b)and Wx-B1(Wx- Blb) proteins that correspond to type 7. The relation between amylose content and starch pasting properties was analyzed using varieties classified into the 8 wheat types (Yamamori and Quynh 2000). Densitometric analysis indicated that the amylose content was related to the amount of Wx protein in the 8 types. Parameters in the Rapid Visco Analyzer test (RVA) and swelling power (SP) were correlated to amylose content. Consequently, amylose content and pasting properties of endosperm starch were influenced most by the lack of the Wx-B1 protein, followed by lack of Wx-D1 and Wx-Al proteins, suggesting the differential effects of the three null alleles for the Wx proteins. Amylose content and parameters based on RVA and SP are related to eating quality such as softness and elasticity of Japanese noodles. The results suggest that lower amylose flour or starch with higher peak viscosity in RVA and higher SP gained higher eating quality scores in noodle sensory tests. Mechanical properties of noodles were also analyzed using near-isogenic lines with different Wx protein deficiency (Ishida et al., 2003). The results indicated that mechanical properties of noodles are primarily determined by the amylose content of flour and properties of starch gel. Sensory evaluation of noodles showed that the noodle made using single-null types lacking either Wx-B1 or Wx-D1 proteins and double-null type lacking both Wx-Al and Wx-Dl proteins had desirable textures for noodle making. Future research will focus on detecting combinations of the three null alleles for Wx proteins that influence improved noodle-making quality through differential control of amylose content in wheat starch orflour. Waxy(amylose-free)wheatvarietywas developed fromthe cross between thelow amyloseJapanese variety, Kanto 107, lacking Wx-A1 and Wx-B1 proteins and the Chinese variety, Bai Huo, missing Wx-D1 protein (Hoshino et al., 1996, Nakamura et al., 1995). Waxy starch of wheat flour is expected to contribute to improving glutinosity, resistance to gel formation and retrogradation. Waxy wheat will be used as materials for enhancing qualities of noodle and bread, for new food diversification and non-food use.The viscoelastic properties and molecular structure of the starch isolated from waxy (amylose-free）hexaploid wheat have been investigated (Hayakawa et al., 1997). Waxy starch generally showed lower gelatinization onset temperature, peak viscosity, and setback than starch isolated from normal hexaploid wheat. Differential scanning calorimetry (DsC) showed that waxy wheat starch had higher transition temperatures and enthalpy than normal wheat starch. However, enthalpy of waxy wheat starch based on amylopectin content was almost the same as that of its parental varieties. Typical A-type X-ray diffraction pattern, higher crystallinity and greater retrogradation resistance also characterized waxy wheat starch.There was little difference in the structure of amylopectin between waxy line and its parental varieties, Kanto 107 and Bai Huo. Further studies are needed to exploit the physicochemical properties specified for waxy starch of wheat compared to waxy starch of maize and rice.) ",

    "input": "(Sweet potato is a major root crop in Asia. Japan produces about 1,300,000 ton of sweet potato annually and has a world ranking of 5' in sweet potato production. The area of sweet potato cultivation has been decreasing and by year 2000 only 50,000ha were planted. In contrast, the yield of sweet potato has rapidly increased to 25 t/ha.Since World War II sweet potato production in Japan has changed emphasis from home consumption to industrial or pre-processing use. A recent trend in consumption of sweet potato is its use as a vegetable and for processing. Breeding strategies for sweet potato have shifted from emphasizing the crop grower to the consumer. The key words in sweet potato breeding are quality improvement for human health and convenience. Regarding human health breeding efforts have been made to improve the content of functional components such as anthocyanins,beta-carotene, polyphenols, dietary fibers, vitamins and minerals. New varieties with higher anthocyanin content have been released.These varieties showed physiological functions associated with anti-oxidation.Purple sweet potato varieties have contributed to creating new processed foods. As leaves and stems of sweet potato are rich in vitamins, minerals and polyphenols varieties suitable for eating fresh as a green vegetable and food processing have been also developed. Leaf extracts from one variety, Suioh, showed strong anti- mutagenic activity. Leaf extracts from sweet potato were compared with those from spinach,lettuce and cabbage regarding inhibitory effect of their extracts on HIV virus proliferation. The result indicated sweet potato extract most effectively prevented HIVvirus from proliferation (Islam et al.,2002). Convenience in terms of sweet potato breeding refers to speed and sweetness in cooking. Sweetness of sweet potato is mainly derived from maltose that is formed from starch by beta-amylase.Normal sweet potato starchis gelatinized above 70°C.Beta-amylase acts on gelatinized starch but it lacks this activity at around 7o°C. Starch with lower gelatinization temperature or heat tolerant beta-amylase is required for quick and sweet cooking property. A newly released variety, QuickSweet, has much lower pasting temperature and unique DSC gelatinization properties compared with standard varieties. This variety can be cooked in a shorter steaming time, probably due to the lower pasting temperature of its starch caused by the change in the structure of amylopectin. Sweet potato starch withlower gelatinization temperature may be useful material for the starch industry because of reduced energy input when starch is converted into alcohol or biodegradable plastic.)

Additionally, the breeding has aimed to improve the cooking properties of sweet potatoes, exemplified by the QuickSweet variety, which features a lower gelatinization temperature allowing for quicker and sweeter cooking.

Control methods are often based on the use of fungicide and of rice resistance, but developing resistant cultivars is the most desirable means for preventing rice blast. Rice has two types of resistance to blast, complete resistance and durable. Complete blast resistance has been associated with spectacular ‘breakdown’ of cultivar resistance. In Korea, the complete resistance of the Tongil cultivars was effective for only 5 years, fungus races able to overcome that resistance, appeared in 1978, and the pathogen had spread all over the country; resulting in a devastating blast epidemic (Crill et al., 1981). In Egypt, Japanese cultivar Reiho possessing the gene Pita-2 for complete resistance, was released in 1984. However, the resistance was lost within the first year after production, resulting in a serious epidemic (Reddy and Bonman, 1987). Bonman (1992) described when the cultivar allowed the pathogen to reproduce that cultivars had various types of resistance included in field resistance (Ezuka) 1979), such as slow blasting (Villareal et al., 1981). quantitative resistance (Ahn and Ou, 1982), dilatory resistance (Marchetti, 1983), and partial resistance (Yeh and Bonman, 1986). In this report, we regarded the resistance without race specificity. Rice cultivars with field resistance to blast have been observed under several production systems, but were not fully analyzed in tropics because of field resistance of each cultivars can be evaluated only when the information on the complete resistance gene are known.

Weeds are one of the most important causes of yield losses in rice. In the upland rice ecosystem, yield loss estimates from weed infestation have ranged from 30 to 100% (Hassan et al.,1994; Pandey, 1996). Moreover, weeds increase production costs and lower rice quality. In the upland rice ecosystem, hand weeding is still the most common practice to control weeds. Although hand weeding is an effective remedy, it is extremely laborious and time-consuming. The time required for hand weeding varies from 45 to 455 d/ha, corresponding to 40 to 50% of the total crop labor input (Roder et al., 1997). In all rice ecosystems, an increase in wage rates has led to a replacement of manual weeding by chemical control and increased concerns regarding environmental and health effects (Bhuiyan and Castaneda, 1995; Pingali et al., 1995). Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify sustainable weed management systems for rice production that will reduce the use of herbicides and the burden of hand weeding.) ",

This study indicated that the allelopathic effect of rice on ducksalad was quantitatively inherited. Manipulation of quantitative traits such as allelopathy based on phenotypic selection is difficult because trials are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and are influenced by environmental factors. In this respect, DNA markers provide us with a powerful tool to dissect and manipulate quantitative trait variation through quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping experiments and marker-assisted selection. The principle of QTL mapping is to detect association between a particular phenotype and molecular markers, which are segregating in a population. This can be done by using an appropriate experimental design, phenotyping techniques, and statistical analysis. Once the genes of interest have been located and the molecular markers closely linked to these genes have been found, gene manipulation is possible through marker-assisted selection (McCouch and Tanksley,1991).)

When data was evaluated across all seeding and N rates, the conventiona tillage system reduced rice density of Jupiter by 25% (Table 2) and Cheniere by 16% (Table 3). The reduction in stand achieved in the conventional tillage system can be explained by crusting of silt loam rice soils which can often occur after a heavy rainfall or flush irrigation event In both instances, stand reduction can occur due to the inability of germinated seedlings to penetrate through the crust. Flush irrigation is often recommended in drill seeded rice production when soil moisture becomes limiting to prevent extensive drought related stand losses. This practice is also recommended to increase germination and prevent stands with wide gaps in maturity which can make growth stage dependent chemical applications problematic.

These findings are in agreement with previous research (Bond et al., 2005) and recommendations (Blanche et al., 2009; Saichuk et al., 2008) that suggest that optimum yields can be achieved in most years with a seeding rate of 323 seed m-2 in a drill seeded delayed food system.

An additional 5% increase was observed between the 323 and 484 seed m-2 rates. These results suggest that more than 323 seed m-2 are needed to maximize yields in Cheniere, disagreeing with previous research which found 323 seed m-2 to be sufficient for Cheniere (Bond e al., 2005).Contrary to these fndings, other seeding rate researc which included rates at or lower than < 323 seed m-2, have shov that rice was able to overcome low densities and produce more reproductive tillers which, in turn, enabled grain yields to be non significantly different at harvest (Jones and Snyder, 1987; Gravo and Helms, 1992; Ottis and Talbert, 2005). The results of this research and similar findings reported by others (Bond et al., 2005, 2008) suggest that while rice can compensate grain yield in low plant populations by producing more tillers,there exists a threshold population where increased tiller production cannot compensate and yield is reduced. In both Jupiter and Cheniere, rough rice grain yields increased with increasing seeding rates (Fig. 1). However, the large yield differences observed at the lowe seeding rates become less pronounced at higher seeding rates. Rough rice yields for Jupiter and Cheniere were affected by rate ofN fertilization (Table 1). Jupiter rough rice yields increased with the increasing rate of N, with a maximum yield (10,981 kg ha-1) occurring at the 202 kg ha- rate (Table 2). Cheniere rough rice grain yield was increased by 4% when N rate was increased from 101 to 134 kg ha-1, and increased an additional 4% when increasing N from 134 to 168 kg ha-1 (Table 3). There were no additional increases in yield with further additions ofN.

The lack ofa seeding rate by N rate interaction (Table 1) in this study suggests that low ricd densities as a function of low seeding rates cannot be compen- sated for by increasing N fertilization.

The primary objectives of the current research were to evaluate themaineffects of tillage, seeding and N rates, and their interactions on rice density, rough rice grain yield, and yield components. Reduced densities and grain yields of rice were observed when conventional tillage was compared to the stale seedbed tillage system.The absence of a grain yield response due to the tillage x N rate interaction suggested that optimal N fertilization is similar for rice grown using conven- tional andfallstale seedbed tillage although,variationdoes exist between cultivars. Rough rice grain yield was optimized at 202 and 168kgNha1 forJupiter and Cheniere, respectively, across alltillage and seeding rates. Rough rice grain yield was optimizee at a seeding rate of 323 seed m-2 for Jupiter, while Cheniere required more that 323 seed m-2 to optimize yield.Filled grain panicle-1 decreased with increasing panicle densities and sug- gests that the increase in tiller production isayield compensator measure in rice when less than optimum rice densities occur. However, total yield compensation may not be feasible at very low seeding rates. Panicle density was found to be the single mos infuential yield component affecting rice yields.) ",

Findings indicate that reduced tillage practices generally result in lower rice densities but do not significantly affect the optimal nitrogen rates needed for different tillage systems. Optimal yields were achieved at specific nitrogen and seeding rates for Jupiter and Cheniere cultivars. The study also highlights that while increased tiller production can compensate for lower rice densities to some extent, it may not fully compensate at very low seeding rates.

The response-surface model consisted of nonlinear yield-density equations where average per-plant yield was the dependent variable and the densities of the competing plant varieties were the independent variables.

Similarly, the parameter describing the area associated with maximum yield per plant was larger for red rice. Red rice was the dominant competitor; the model indicated that it took approximately three Mars plants to have the same effect on the grain yield of Mars as only one red rice plant.

Consequently, an objective growth staging system with enumeration adapted to cumulative leaf number (CLN) would improve communication among scientists, farmers, and educators. We propose a rice developmental staging system divided into three main phases of development: seedling, vegetative, and reproductive.

Vegetative development consists of stages V1, V2 ... VN; N being equal to the final number of leaves with collars on the main stem. Reproductive development consists of 10 growth stages based on discrete morphological criteria: panicle initiation (R0), panicle differentiation (R1), flag leaf collar formation (R2), panicle exertion (R3), anthesis (R4), grain length and width expansion (R5), grain depth expansion (R6), grain dry down (R7), single grain maturity (R8), and complete panicle maturity (R9). Assigning rice growth stages based on discrete morphological criteria will result in unambiguous growth-stage determination.

Therefore, to ensure food security, it is necessary to assess the response and adaptation of crop phenology to the natural (mainly climate change) and artificial (including sowing date (SD) change and cultivar shift) factors. In this study, using field data from 113 agro-meteorological experiment stations across China, along with the Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) oryza model, we investigated the trends of rice phenology in relation to climate change and agronomic factors (i.e., SD change and cultivar shift) from 1981 to 2010.

    "input": "(Climate condition is one of the most important environmental factors that affect crop phenology and yield (Shi et al. 2015; Yan and Hunt 1999). During the past six decades, the globally averaged surface temperature increased 0.12 °C 10a-1(IPCC 2014).Many studies showed that warming temperature accelerated crop development and shortened growth duration, leading to negative impact on crop productivity (Hu et al. 2017; Xiao et al. 2015). On the other hand, phenological shifts are important ecological indicators of the impact of climate change (Xiao et al. 2013). Rice is the staple cereal crop in China, accounting for 36.6% of the total cereal production and 32.0% of the total cereal crops area in 2016 (http://www.stats.gov.cn). From 1980s to 2000s, the average temperature during rice growth period increased rice,and 0.38 °C 10afor late-rice in China (Zhang et al. 2013).Zhang et al.(2013) showed the average 4.1- 4.4 days shortening in rice growth duration with every 1 °C increase in average temperature from emergence to maturity. Although climate warming had a negative impact on the length of rice growth period,the actual length of rice growth period had no significant change or even was prolonged in most area of China (Liu et al. 2012; Tao et al. 2013). The main reason was that crop phenology was controlled by the combined effects of climate change and agronomic factors (Bock et al.2013; Xiao et al. 2016). Over the past decades,cultivar shift compensated for shortening growth period of single-rice and early-rice due to climate warming, but accelerated the process of late-rice (Tao et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2013). As the results in Hu et al. (2017), cultivar shift prolonged the whole growth phase (WGP, from SD to MD)ofsingle-riceandearly-riceby6.1and 1.7 days 10a', respectively, while it shortened the WGP of late-rice by 4.1 days 10a-l during the period of 1981-2012. Moreover, proper change in SD is also an effectiveadaptation strategyfor crop todeal with ongoing climate change (Bai and Tao 2017). Delay in SD of late-rice retarded the acceleration by 29% in terms of WGP change (Hu et al. 2017). To develop adaptation practices to cope with climate change,it is necessary tofurther study the attribution of the observed changes of rice phenology over the past decades. Most of previous studies used statistical models to disentangle the contribution of climate change and cul- tivar shift to crop phenology change (Tao et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2013). However, statistical models cannot separate the effect of SD change from the effect of climate change.Moreover, statistical models generally assume that change of growth period is a constant on liner response to climate variations, which is not con- sistent with reality (Lobell et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2013).Crop model is a component-driven model that simulates crop growth, development, and final yield. By designing contrast experiments, crop model is a use- ful approach for disentangling the effect of climate change and agronomic factors on crop phenology or yield (Xiao et al. 2016). For example, Bai et al. (2016）has assessed the effect of climate change, SD change, and cultivar shift on crop yield under rice and wheat rotation system via APSIM-oryza and APSIM- wheatmodel simulating. In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal changes of rice phenology from 1981 to 2010,and determined the relationshipbetweenphenological changes of rice and climate change, SD change, and cultivar shift based on APSIM-oryza model. The main aim is (1) to characterize the spatio-temporall variability of rice phenology across China and (2) to investi- gate the cause of the characterized spatio-temporal variability. This study will demonstrate the impact of climate change, SD change, and cultivar shift on rice phenology, and guide the optimizationof adaptationoptionsforriceproduction.) ",

Studies in recent years have shown that MAS is an effective approach for reducing the cost and improving the efficacy and accuracy of selection for plant breeding (Ribaut and Hoisington, 1998; Young et al., 1999). However, there are only a small number of reports on quantitative trait improvement, especially for yield-related traits, even though numerous QTLs for yield and associated traits have been identified in rice. The instability of QTL expression and the lack of reliable markers are two critical barriers to large-scale utilization of MAS in high-yield rice breeding (Zhu et al., 2011). GW directly and obviously affects yield. Breeders tend to select plants with large seed size for high yield and appropriate grain size for milling yield and market preferences. Viewed from the perspective of mechanics, the larger the GW, the more favorable it is for farmers. GW is generally extremely significantly correlated with cooking qualities and the physical appearance (Stangoulis et al., 2007). Therefore, it might be possible to obtain higher yields by designing an ideal GW. Using molecular marker maps and QTL mapping technology, numerous QTLs linked to rice GW were reported (Lin et al., 1996; Cui et al., 2003; Ishimaru, 2003). However, until now, only a few QTLs for GW had been isolated. One of the reasons is that rice GW is controlled by a polygenic system. Another reason is the lack of genetic populations suitable for GW QTL isolation. To elucidate the genetic basis of important agronomic traits, NILs or ILs have been developed (Eshed et al.,1995; Ishimaru et al., 2005; Dai et al., 2008). These NILs and ILs were used to confirm QTLs that were putatively detected in primary populations, such as F2s, recombinant inbred lines (RILs), or backcross inbred lines (BILs). Additionally, NILs and ILs could also contribute to the analysis of the physiological functions of QTLs and to the identification of the underlying genes by map-based strategies (Fan et al., 2006).)

The current environmental problems caused by the sustainability of water consumption have become priority research areas especially in rainfed area where the rainfall is the main source of water or plant growth. The lack of water is also threatening the sustainable production of rice especially in Asia where rice is the most important cereal crop (Bouman and Tuong, 2001). Due to erratic rainfall, drought stress is a serious limiting factor to achieve rice production stability, and a major problem to yield. Drought effect differs according to varieties, growth stage, level and duration to drought stress (Kato, 2004). Drought effect may have different impacts on reducing yield (Forbes and Watson, 1994; Lafitte et al.,2007） and declining rice production generally (Bouman et al.,2005) due to decreasing ingrowthandphotosynthetic rate (Siddique et al., 1999; Zlatev and Lidon, 2012), Upland rice plays an important role in bringing cleared areas into cultivation by finding characters oftolerance toacid,aluminium-toxicsoils (Pinheiro et al., 2006). The problems of acid soils are complex even the major growth-limiting factor for upland rice differs depending on the degree of soil acidity. Phosphorus (P) deficiency is a major abiotic stress that limits rice productivity, particularly under upland conditions in acid soils such as ultisol and alfisol (Kirk et al., 1998). Dobermann et al.(1998)estimated that more than 90%ofaddedfertilizerPmayberapidly transformed toP forms that are not easily available toplants.) ",

Erratic rainfall and low soil nutrition of P are specific problems and as the main factor of food production in rainfed dry land area and it has a high risk on production (Fageria and Baligar, 1997; Amberger, 2000). Rice as a staple food in Indonesia is the first priority to obtain national demand of food and it's mentioned in strategic planning of Indonesian Agricultural Research and Development Agency 2010-2014 due to it has not been met national demand yet. Expansive area of rice production in Indonesia to uplandland areas is one alternative to keep and support national food security. Large potency of upland areas could be possible to support upland rice production and enhance contribution to national rice production (Center of Research and Development, 2008). Selected variety could be possible adaptable grown under specific constraints of limited water and low P availabilities to enhance production. Moreover, those varieties might have the characters of drought tolerance, P efficient and high yield. This is an option and one solution to improve upland rice production to meet national production demand. Several studies were done regarding to P performance in plant (Fageria et al., 1988; Wissuwa, 2003; Akinrinde and Gaizer, 2006; Li et al., 2009), and plant performance under drought condition (Hirayama et al., 2006; Venuprasad et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2007; Lasalita-Zapico et al., 2008).

Overexpression of OsPHR2 induced the expression of a number of PSI genes and greatly increased Pi uptake in the Pi sufficient condition (Fig. 2), resulting in plant toxicity due to Pi overaccumulation (Zhou et al. 2008). Limited Pi supply or decreased Pi uptake could alleviate or even diminish the Pi toxicity of PHR2-Oe plants (Liu et al. 2010; Zhou et al. 2008). Interestingly, no obvious toxic symptoms were observed when Pi overaccumulation was induced in PHR2-Oe plants grown in a paddy field with a normal Pi supply (Fig. 3). Because the paddy field condition can promote the mobilization and solubility of phosphate (Huguenin-Elie et al. 2009), it is unlikely that the diminished Pi toxicity symptoms of PHR2-Oe plants grown in a paddy field is due to poor access of the plant roots to the soil Pi. Waterlogging in the paddy field causes oxygen deficiency by decreasing the solubility and diffusion of oxygen, which inhibits respiration and oxidative phosphorylation in plants (Colmer and Greenway 2011; Hattori et al. 2011; Huang et al. 2008). Adaptation responses to oxygen deficiency include the formation of aerenchyma in the roots, suberin and lignin production in the outer part of the roots and an increase in the adventitious root number. While these adaptive responses increase oxygen availability in the roots and decrease ROL (Colmer and Greenway 2011; Insalud et al. 2006; Shiono et al. 2011), the aerenchyma and apoplastic barriers that develop inhibit nutrient uptake and translocation to the shoot (Colmer and Greenway 2011).)

Upland rice, which contains water-saving and drought-resistant characters, is an important genetic resource (Bernier et al. 2008). It is essential to collect, conserve, and evaluate the upland rice germplasm for drought resistance (Luo 2010). However, an absence of ecotype information is common in rice conservation. A convenient molecular method for distinguishing upland and lowland rice is required. To develop such a method, the genetic features between these two rice ecotypes should be a priority. For example, Ishikawa et al. (1992) found an isozyme gene “pdg,” which had different allele types between upland and lowland rice. Based on RFLP markers developed from “pdg,” they further designed a discriminating system that could distinguish upland and lowland rice from Japan (Ishikawa et al. 1997). Recently, studies have reported that significant differentiation between upland and lowland rice occurs on selective loci (Xia et al. 2014), which play a role in rice ecotypes adapting to different agro-ecosystems of contrasting soil water conditions (Lyu et al. 2014; Xia et al. 2014). The discriminating index in this study was developed based on the allele frequencies of the selective loci in upland and lowland ecotypes.

In general, Asian cultivated rice is classified into two types, Japonica and Indica. The former is mainly cultivated in northeast Asia, whereas the latter is widely cultivated in tropical Asian countries (Oka1988). Most of the Japonica-type cultivated rice has strong non-seed shattering behaviour and few seeds drop from the panicles. But with Indica type, external forces such as hand gripping and hitting against stones will detach mature seeds. These differences in seed-shattering degree may be generated by spontaneous mutations and selected through various harvesting styles. Probably, natural variation of seed-shattering degree is quantitatively regulated by a combination of mutated alleles at shattering loci.) ",

    "output": "The study utilized five parental rice lines with varying allelopathic potentials in a partial diallel crossing to produce 10 F1 hybrids. These were tested for their allelopathic effects on lettuce at different growth stages under two conditions. The study found that additive and dominant genetic effects alternated across the growth stages of rice seedlings. Specifically, additive effects were significant during the 5|4, 6|5, and 8|7-leaf stages, while dominance effects were more pronounced during the 4|3 and 7|6 leaf stages. Both narrow and broad sense heritability were significant, indicating that these stages are optimal for selecting for allelopathic traits to enhance breeding outcomes.",

Although many transcriptome analyses of rice have been conducted, this is the first study to examine differential gene expression in young panicles of rice in response to nitrogen fertilizer. Digital gene expression tag profiling is a revolutionary approach for gene expression analysis. Here, differential gene expression was analyzed in young panicles that received different applications of fertilizer. Digital gene expression analysis identified hundreds of genes that significantly differed in their expression level after the plants received nitrogen treatment. Of note, nitrogen fertilizer significantly reduced several major photoperiod sensitivity regulators that trigger flowering in rice. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis also showed that the expression of two florigen genes, Headingdate3a (Hd3a) and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1), was repressed in leaves by nitrogen fertilizer. In addition, the expression of two important genes that control panicle size, OsEATB and DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE1 (DEP1), was significantly promoted by nitrogen fertilizer. The identification of novel differentially expressed genes provides new insights into the profound impacts of nitrogen fertilizer on panicle development and may suggest new strategies to improve yield in rice.)

The seed setting rate, which is one of the most important components of rice yield,has attracted much research interest over the past few decades. Rice seed setting is a complicated quantitative trait that is influenced by the male gamete fertility, female gamete fertility, extent of anther dehiscence, and environmental con- ditions, such as temperature (Liu et al. 2004). Several genes thatcontrol theseedsettingratehavebeen characterizedin rice,includingPTB1,THIS1,GSD1,GSL5,OsSPX1,and Laccase-13 (OsLAC13). PTB1, which encodes a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, positively regulates rice seed setting by promoting pollen tube growth (Li et al. 2013).THISI, which encodes a class III lipase, regulates both tillering and seed set (Liu et al. 2013). GSD1,which encodes a putative remorinprotein,causesimpaired transport of carbohydrates from photosynthetic sites to phloem, influencing seed set- ting (Gui et al. 2014).
