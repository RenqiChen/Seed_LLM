The less desirable aroma of meat in groups BMS and MDMS could be due to the higher PUFA content of fat or n-6-to-n-3 PUFA ratio. While SFA are more stable as they become oxidized at high temperatures, PUFA may be oxidized in raw meat or at low temperatures PUFA oxidation products may cause an unpleasant odour in meat (Doreau and Chiliard, 1997; Geay et al., 2001). Farmer (1994) reports that the n-6-to-n-3 ratio may also contribute to a change in meat aroma.
