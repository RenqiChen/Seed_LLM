The chemical analysis of the soil, conducted according to the methodology proposed by Raij and Quaggio (1983), showed the following values: pH in CaCl2 4.4; 18 g dm-3 M.O.; 14 g dm-3 Presina? 43, 0.50, 8.0, and 4.0 mmol. dm-3 of H+Al, K, Ca, and Mg, respectively, and base saturation of 23%. A sample of the soil was conditioned in volumetric rings of 100 cmÂ³ to determine water retention at tensions of -0.3, -1.0, and -15.0 atm, using the Richards pressure chamber method (EMBRAPA, 1997). The need for liming was calculated according to Raij et al. (1997), aiming to raise the base saturation to 60%. After the incorporation of limestone, the soil was moistened to 80% of field capacity and maintained at this moisture level for twenty days. Along with the limestone, 50 mg dm-3 N, 200 mg dm-3 P, and 150 mg dm-3 K were incorporated, in the forms of urea, simple superphosphate, and potassium chloride, respectively. The experimental design was a randomized block in a 4x3 factorial scheme, with four repetitions. Four species of grasses were evaluated: Avena strigosa Sckreb, Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Brown cv. ADR300, Sorghum bicolor L. Moench., and Sorghum bicolor subspecies bicolor race guinea, and three soil water potentials: -0.3 atm (field capacity), -1.0 atm (initial water deficit), and -15.0 atm (permanent wilting point).

However, the potentials used in this study were chosen specifically to compare the development of the species under extreme conditions of water availability. Ten seeds per pot were sown, leaving six seedlings at the time of thinning, fifteen days after emergence. At 25 days after emergence, top dressing was carried out, applying 50 mg N dm-Â³ (urea) and 50 mg K dm-Â³ (KCl) in solution form. The soil moisture of all treatments was maintained close to field capacity (-0.3 atm) until fifteen days after plant emergence. The three water potentials were imposed from this date and remained until the end of the experiment. The soil water content was controlled by daily weighing of the pots and replenishing the amount of water lost.
