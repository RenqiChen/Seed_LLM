    "input": "(In Mexico, corn (Zea mays L.) is fundamental to the culinary and cultural traditions of the rural society (Leyva et al., 2020; Novotny et al., 2021). The acceptance and reproduction of this crop is based on the diversification of its use and the adaptation of the 68 races to their uses and the different weather conditions (Caballero, Cordova, and Lopez, 2019). Only 22% of the arable land in Mexico can be considered as high-quality land with irrigation, while 78% of the arable land is used for rainfed agriculture. In the latter area, corn crops are grown under milpa production systems. Corn is the main product of traditional agriculture (Turrent et al., 2014; Rodriguez et al., 2020; Lopez et al., 2021). The milpa is a complex system with synergies between its plants and weeds, such as tolerance, protection, nutrient fixation, and pest management, among others (Caballero and Cortes, 2001; Eyzaguirre and Linares, 2004). In practice, these agroecosystems are dynamic and adaptable to such an extent that they have currently diversified from polycultures to monocultures to satisfy the soil, market, or destination of the production requirements (Guzman,2016; Sosa and Gonzalez,2021) In this scenario, analyzing the different productive aspects of the said agroecosystem's regional adaptations is fundamental. This analysis compares those regional adaptations with the adaptations, improvement points, and agronomic optimization required to increase the agricultural yields, according to the requirements of the farmers and their ethno-biologicaluses. Consequently, the objective of this study was to compare the yield of corn crops grown under milpa production systems, in three different scenarios. The productive versions of this agroecosystem were compared based on the data from the Valles Centrales in Oaxaca, Valle de Serdan in Puebla, and Zongolica, in Veracruz.

This difference matches the productive, technological, investment, and priority capacities of each farmer group that develops every version of the agroecosystem in question (Table 8). For example, the modern agriculture production system used in Villa de Zaachila Oaxaca had the highest material and labor investment ($13,650.00 ha-I); nevertheless the said expenditure was compensated by the economic benefits ($23,429.27 ha-l). This amountdoublestheinitialinvestment. Meanwhile, in the scenarios with highest limitations regarding investment, installed capacities, and availability of materials,the productive results were not favorable. Regarding traditional agriculture in Chalchicomula, the total cost of investment ($12,380.00 ha vas similar to the investment of the modern agriculture system, as a result of the use of machinery, labor, and even a minimum amount of agricultural material. Consequently a considerable production volume was obtained (2,456 kg ha-l). However, the uneven commercial relations with the intermediaries favored low selling prices, reducing their incomes ($12,280.00 ha-). Finally, the case of the subsistence agriculture in Tequila shows a completely different view, as a consequence of the importance given to coffee as main source of income replacing the milpa production system which becomes a complementary and specific self-consumption activity. Therefore, the milpa is only an afterthought, taking up “spare materials and labor from the coffee crops. This situation accounts for the small areas used (0.56 ha) and the low investment spent ($7,350.00 ha-') in the milpa. In synthesis, analyzing the productive nuances of the production systems is fundamental.However, this analysis must simultaneously take into account tho agricultural, ecological, social, cultural, political, and economy aspects of the regional adaptations. Subsequently, these adaptations must be compared in order to determine their optimal modifications, aimed to the economic benefit of farmer families. Theso adaptations must also enable the growth of corn crops within an economic model despite harsh conditions —such as production costs, uneven commercial relations, and low installed capacity, among others.)

Under this circumstance, food security has been identified as a major concern by different countries especially the underdeveloped countries to contribute to its socio-economic stabilization as well as development (Kashem and Faroque, 2011). But the agricultural production is under severe strain to satisfy the food demand due to limited resource and energy, climate change, soil degradation and higher reliance on certain crops. To accomplish the food goal, production per unit area must be raised while resources are well utilized. Maize (Zea mays) is a fast-growing, high-yielding cereal crop that has the potential to alleviate global cereal crop shortages. It is the third most significant grain crop in the world pertaining to the grass family Poaceae (Djaman et al., 2018). Maize is produced for human and animal sustenance all over the world. This crop is consumed as a main diet by many people in Mexico, Central and South America and parts of Africa whereas in Europe and the rest of North America it is popular for animal feed. Because of its C4 pathway, it has a high rate of photosynthetic activity, resulting in higher grain yield and biomass potential. Maize grain is a rich source of starch, protein, oil, fiber and minerals (Reddy and Reddy, 2003). Some researchers considered maize as more nutritious than rice in terms of protein, phosphorus and carotene content. Various food items viz. soup, corn flakes, khichuri bhutta polao etc. can be prepared from maize. Maize flour alone or in combination with flour from other cereals and pulses is also used to make bread, mixed parota, pulse puri and other foods. In fact, it can be utilized in the same way as rice and wheat.) ",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of competition between transgenic maize and five weed species on the growth and yield of transgenic maize hybrid. The experiment used a randomized block design with four replicates in a factorial 5 x 2 + 6 scheme consisting of a combination of maize under competition with five weed species (Bidens pilosa, Commelina benghalensis, Brachiaria brizantha, Sorghum arundinaceum, and Ipomoea triloba) in two weed densities (15 or 30 plants m-²) plus six treatments corresponding to maize and weed species without competition. All the means for dry matter accumulated by maize plants in the stem and leaf in the density of 15 plants m 2 were higher than the means for plants in coexistence with 30 plants m-2. Number of kernels, diameter and length of cob were not affected by competition with weeds. The weeds that most interfered with maize biomass production were S. arundinaceum and B. brizantha. Leaf dry mass accumulation was more sensitive than the production of stem. It was observed that maize was usually very competitive with weeds, and there was a strong decrease in dry matter accumulation of all the weeds in the study when in coexistence with the crop.) ",

    "input": "(INTRODUCTION Maize (Zea mays) is a major cereal grown worldwide, providing products for various industries - including human and animal foods - and raw materials for industry. Brazil currently stands out as one of the largest maize producers in the world, with an estimated production of 79,000 tonnes in the 2013/2014 harvest (CONAB, 2013). However, Brazilian productivity per hectare is considered to be low, estimated at 5,108 kg ha-1 (CONAB, 2013), which is almost half of the average production of North American crops, which is approximately 10,000 kg ha-1 (USDA, 2013). One of the factors that negatively affect the yield of maize is weed interference, whereby weeds may directly compete with crops for nutrients, water, space and light, and also indirectly, when they are alternative hosts to pathogens and insect pests, or when they hinder harvesting. Weed-crop competition is influenced by weed species, density and population in crops (Zanine & Santos, 2004). Coexistence with weeds can modify plant morphology (Wandscheer & Rizzardi, 2013), biomass accumulation, plant growth (Rajcan & Swanton, 2001) and, successively, the yield of crops of interest (Rajcan & Swanton, 2001; Bianchi et al., 2006; Marquardt et al., 2012; Cerrudo et al., 2012). Such coexistence may cause species to accumulate less biomass (Mohammadi, 2007), although growth and productive capacity of crops may remain unaltered (Cerrudo et al., 2012; Wandscheer & Rizzardi, 2013). Genes of interest are inserted into genetically modified organisms, providing a given crop with desired traits. For DKB 390 PRO 2 maize, there are two technologies that make it resistant to the herbicide glyphosate and caterpillar pests. These changes may not directly interfere with the adaptability of the plant to the environment, but different management of transgenic compared with non-transgenic maize makes pest control easier and reduces costs (Wolfenbarger & Phifer, 2000). Despite the importance of competitive adaptation of plants to the productive sector. there are few studies evaluating the) ",
    "output": "The introduction highlights the significance of maize as a major global cereal crop, particularly in Brazil, which is one of the largest producers yet has relatively low productivity per hectare compared to North America. The text discusses how weed interference can negatively impact maize yield by competing for resources and serving as hosts for pests. It also touches on how genetically modified maize, specifically DKB 390 PRO 2, is engineered for resistance to certain pests and herbicides, potentially easing management and reducing costs.

As many as 35 OPV varieties were assessed and clustered into groups by using fuzzy c means algorithm. The result indicated that fuzzy model clustering enabled to develop a relationship among the OPV maize and morphological traits. Based on the similarity among agronomic characters, OPV maize varieties can be clustered into four group. Group I represent high productivity, drought and disease tolerant varieties. Group II contains maize varieties characterized by late silking and maturity days. Further, Group IHI represent varieties with the earliest maturity varieties and low grain yield. Group IV indicates the OPV maize having moderate grain yield and susceptible to downy mildew disease. The information on similarity among variety or group can be used for varietal improvement programs such as recombination and molecular based gene introgression not only for maize but also other crops.

There were inter-population differences in phenological characters as time from germination to tassel emergence, from germination to spike emergence and from germination to anthesis (length of vegetative cycle -LVC). The morphological and phenological data here reported were used to carry out a cluster analysis, in which the F and Pc populations appeared as two separate groups and the F-Pc populations were included in the F group. Thus, the well-defined F (including F-Pc) and Pc genetic pools should be prioritised within the framework of breeding plans as well as ex situ and in situ conservation programs. For these purposes it is essential the morphological, phenological and genetic characterisation the maize Guarani landraces.) ",

It is cultivated from Alberta in Canada to the province of Chubut in Argentina, and from sea level to 4,000 m.a.s.1 (Samayoa et al. 2018). The first extensive study of maize morphological diversity in Latin America was led by Sergey Bukasov from the Soviet Institute of Applied Botany, as part of Nikolai Vavilov's efforts to investigate the diversity and utility of crops worldwide. The analysis of over 8,000 maize populations sampled globally revealed that at extreme latitudes (e.g., Argentinian Patagonia region) plants are short, have few leaves and a short vegetative cycle, whereas in tropical regions (e.g.,) as Yucatan and southern Colombia) plants are tall, have many leaves and show a long vegetative cycle (Kuleshov 1930,1933). Maize landraces are classified by the characteristics of the ear, grain, tassel, whole plant and their geographic distribution (Goodman & Brown 1988).) ",

In the case of opportunistic human fungal pathogens, these mechanisms have often emerged as a consequence of the expansion of specific gene families and clusters that confer flexibility in nutrient acquisition, host recognition, and adhesion.

    "input": "(The intercropping of maize with perennial tropical forages provides an effective mean of deploying Integrated Crop-Livestock System (ICLS) in tropical agriculture. In this intercrop, the forage and maize are sown at the same time, coexisting through all maize cycle. After harvesting the maize, forage can be used for grazing. If well-managed, this intercrop results in the same yield as sole maize production and an additional 2 to 5 Mg ha of Urochloa spp. biomass in dry season, the most used forage genus for this purpose (Pariz et al., 2011; Almeida et al., 2018). During coexistence period, the forage can compete with maize for resources, such as light, water, nutrients and space. Ensuring lower competition for maize growth resources is a key factor for the success of the intercrop. For this matter, some measures have been used, such as spraying low herbicides rates on the forage. Using lower herbicides rates than the recommended aims at hindering forage growth during coexistence period (Jakelaitis et al., 2006). The most used herbicide to suppress the forage growth in ICLS is nicosulfuron (Almeida et al.,2018; Oliveira et al., 2018; Pariz et al.,2017). Despite the fact that the recommended rate of nicosulfuron is lethal to Urochloa spp., the low rate may cause suppression on forage, decreasing the competition between the two species (Anésio et al., 2017). It provides maize competitive advantage over Urochloa spp, resulting in reduced light availability to the forage. As maize intercepts more sunlight, it grows faster and uses resources quicker. By doing so, it becomes the dominant species of the intercrop and Urochloa, the subordinate one. Urochloa remains shaded during maize cycle and most of the times it results in etiolation process of the forage (Paciullo et al.,2011). Etiolation alters the chemical composition and morphology of the forage, affecting fibrous accumulation on stem (Pariz et al., 2016).Etiolation effects on Urochloa could be reduced using post-emergence herbicides during the period of shadow, which would be desirable because etiolation enhances the lignin content in the plant tissues, decreasing its digestion by ruminants (Gallego-Giraldo et al., 2016). Overall, stretched out plants have less leaf/stem ratio and enhanced lignin content, limiting factors for selection and forage intake by grazing animals (Glienke et al., 2016). However, the effect of the herbicide applied post-emergence on intercropped grasses morphology is) ",
    "output": "The text discusses the benefits and mechanisms of intercropping maize with Urochloa spp. in an Integrated Crop-Livestock System (ICLS). It highlights how low rates of nicosulfuron herbicide are used to manage competition for resources between maize and Urochloa, giving maize a competitive advantage. This management strategy reduces light competition and suppresses Urochloa growth, which can lead to etiolation. Etiolation affects the forage's chemical composition and morphology, increasing lignin content and reducing its nutritional value for grazing. The use of post-emergence herbicides is suggested to mitigate these effects, aiming to maintain high-quality forage.",

    "input": "(The impact of nitrogen fertilization on plants depends on soil conditions, climatic factors and agrotechnology, plant type and the method of fertilizer application (Blankenau et al. 2002). Balik (1986) states that plants under conditions of the Czech Republic, uptake less than 50% of fertilizer. Nitrogen fertilization in maize influences mostly the number of kernels per ear, ear length and 1000 kernel weight (Petr et al. 1988). The principle of the CULTAN (controlled uptake long term ammonium nutrition) method lies in single application of nitrogenous fertilizers containing the ammonium cation to the root space; essential nitrogen is thus provided to a plant in available form that is little mobile in soil (Sommer 2005). The most frequently used form of the CULTAN method is injection of liquid ammonium fertilizer into soil creating so-called ‘depots’ (Boelcke 2003, Kubesova et al.2013a). Such ammonium depots are resistant to nitrification processes due to high concentration of ammonium in soil (Sommer 2005) Positively charged ammonium ion is bound in soil to negatively charged clay particles and organic compounds (Kicke and Scherer 2006). It is therefore possible to reduce nitrogen fertilization into one single dose at vegetation period (Boelcke 2003). At CULTAN method the symptoms of ammonium nitrogen toxicity on fertilized plants were not observed; Sommer (2005) explains that at the CULTAN method of fertilization only part of the roots participate in the uptake of ammonium nitrogen from the depots margins. The roots uptake nitrogen out of there only if they are sufficiently supplied with saccharides from the aboveground parts and plants can thus use nitrogen in metabolism of the nitrogenous compounds. The roots that participate in uptake of nitrogen and ammonium from depots become denser and branch due to saccharides produced in the aboveground part of plant and their distribution changes according to the plant growth stage; they usually grow from the free soil towards depots. Absorbed ammonia in roots is immediately bound to amino acids that may be translocated in roots and the lower part of straw directly towards the growth centres.) ",
    "output": "The text explains the CULTAN method of nitrogen fertilization, which involves a single application of ammonium-based fertilizer directly into the soil, forming concentrated depots. This method is designed to provide plants with a stable and efficient nitrogen source that minimizes nitrification and loss. The positively charged ammonium ions bind to soil particles, reducing mobility and enhancing uptake efficiency. The roots absorb nitrogen when needed, supported by saccharides from the plant's aboveground parts, leading to denser and more branched root systems. This method avoids nitrogen toxicity and optimizes nutrient use within the plant.",

    "input": "(At none of the sites during the three years of trial a decrease of plants related to the CULTAN applied fertilization was observed. In 2010 the lowest number of ears was observed at Hnevceves, whereas the highest at Ivanovice, where the conventional treatment and CULTAN UAS treatment reached statistically significantly higher number of ears than the CULTAN UAN+ IN treatment. The influence of inhibitor on ear number may be observed in the same year at Humpolec site, where the 4th treatment reached by 20.5% higher number of ears compared to CULTAN UAN. In 2011, significantly higher number of ears per plant was detected related to the fertilization treatment in Hnevceves site where the CULTAN UAS treatment reached ear number higher by 12.4% in comparison with conventional treatment. In the same year at Ivanovice site CULTAN treatment gave lower number of ears per plant; it was however compensated by statistically significantly longer ears and higher number of kernels in ear and also by higher thousand weight kernel (TKW), which confirms a positive impact of injection methods of fertilization CULTAN on principle yield parameters in maize. The reason may be a longer period of assimilate storage at CULTAN-fertilized plants (Sommer 2005). In 2012, statistically significantly higher number of ears was obtained at all treatments at Hnevceves Yet, no statistically significant treatment-related differences in number of ears per plant were observed at either of sites in 2012. In 2010 the impact of fertilization on ear length at Hnevceves and Ivanovice sites was not statistically significant, where at Humpolec the ears longer by 4.2% were observed at 2nd treatment compared to conventional treatment and by 6.7% longer than at 3rd treatment, which is statistically significant (Table 5). In 2011 no statistically evident differences in the ear length in relation to treatments were found at any station. In 2012 statistically evident shorter ears were observed at injection treatment with sulphur at Ivanovice in comparison with other treatments. The lowest number of kernels per ear was obtained at Hnévceves in 2010 and 2011 (Table 6), probably due to below-average precipitations in July and August, which is supported by the results of Zinselmeier et al. (1999), who reported a water deficit 5 days before earing stage to be critical and to strongly affect the number of kernels per ear. However, at 2nd and 4th treatments, a tendency to higher number of kernels per ear was observed, which is confirmed by Sommer (2005) who states that CULTAN-fertilized plants are more resistant to drought. In 2011 at Ivanovice all CULTAN treatments reached statistically significantly higher number of kernels per ear, even though the yield in this year was influenced by several stress factors (May ground frosts, strong precipitation deficit in May, July and August). Bertin and Gallais (2000) state that the nitrogen-deficiency stress has a 32% share on reduction of number of kernels in ear. The trial has not confirmed a negative impact of CULTAN-fertilization, which causes a nitrogen deficiency in plants at the beginning of the vegetation period, on the number of kernels per ear compared to the conventional treatment. Total weight of kernels obtained in maize (Zea mays L.) is strongly genetically influenced (Reddy and Daynard 1983). However, stress conditions such as drought (Brooks et al. 1982), assimilates availability (Blum 1998) and temperature (Wardlaw and Wrigley 1994) significantly affect the final values of TKW. Influence of the above-mentioned stressors on TKW was observed in 2010; at all sites the lowest values were obtained due to cold and rainy weather at the grain filling stage which negatively affected kernel weight. At Hnevceves in 2011 higher TKW was obtained in CULTAN UAS treatment (Table 6), which confirms synergic effect of nitrogen and sulphur on yield formation (Malhi et al. 2007). Tendency to higher TKW at CULTAN treatments was observed in 2012 at Ivanovice, where the statistically significant difference between conventional and CULTAN UAN + IN treatments was observed. It may be supposed that in this year with spring frosts at the time of maize emergence and an extreme lack of precipitation at the time of grain filling a positive impact of sink/source effect occurred at CULTAN treatments (Sommer and Scherer 2007); it is in compliance with the statement by Borras and Otegui (2001) who reported that an increase of TKW is related to changes in the sink-source ratio during post-anthesis. In 2011 smaller length of plants was observed at CULTAN treatments at all experimental sites which is explained by Sommer (2005) as a consequence of change in the ratio of the aboveground parts and roots due to N deficiency at the beginning of vegetation. The same tendency was reported by Sedlar et al. (2011) at CULTAN-fertilized spring barley. In 2010 at all sites a clear tendency to lower yields at CULTAN treatments was observed (Table 7). The lowest yield in this year was obtained at Hnevceves at surface CAN application. The possible explanation is that the basic fertilization at conventional treatment combined with colder summer months accelerated initial growth compared to the CULTAN treatments. On the contrary, at Ivanovice all CULTAN treatments had similar yields as conventional treatment, which may be caused by faster mineralisation at this site and faster initial growth of maize plants at CULTAN treatments; nitrogen deficiency caused by basic fertilization was fixed with fast mineralization. In 2011 higher yields were obtained at CULTAN treatments compared to conventional treatment at Hnevceves and Ivanovice sites. At Hnevceves site, statistically significantly higher yield by 15.3% at 4th treatment over the conventional one. Higher yield of CULTAN fertilization according to Sommer (2005) is explained by longer time of assimilate storage in ears. Blaylock and Cruse (1990) in his trials with maize also observed a statistically significant increase in kernel yield from nitrogen injection-applied UAN fertilizer compared to surface application. At this site, higher yield was formed by higher number of kernels at CULTAN treatments, which was caused by favourable weather conditions during grain filling stage. At Ivanovice site, higher yields at CULTAN treatments were given by higher number of kernels and higher TKW. Slightly warmer months in 2011 and 2012 at Humpolec had a significant impact on smaller differences in kernel yield in dependence on the fertilization treatment. The highest kernel yield in 2011 was recorded at CULTAN UAN treatment, the difference over conventional treatment being 5.6%. In 2012 at Ivanovice the absolute values showed lower yields at all treatments compared to the previous year, which was caused by late spring frosts. Yet, the tendency to higher yields in CULTAN treatments was observed, which is in compliance with the statement of Sommer (2005) that the CULTAN-fertilized plants are more resistant to stress. Distinctive differences in maize kernel yields were observed in 2012 at the Hnevceves site where all injection-fertilized treatments reached higher yields compared to conventional treatment. At CULTAN UAN treatment a yield higher by 13.6% was recorded compared to conventional treatment. Even though the absolute values show very high yields at all treatments and sowing was slightly delayed because of the weather conditions, it may be stated that the CULTAN fertilization of maize decreases the impact of delayed sowing on kernel yield. Statistically significant positive direct impact of sulphur in fertilizer on maize plants was not observed at either of the sites. Based on the results of the three-year experiment (Table 7), it is possible to agree with the statement of Walter (2003) that the nitrogen fertilization of maize using the CULTAN method in Germany shows the same yield certainty as conventional surface application, which was confirmed under the conditions of the Czech Republic, and that the CULTAN method of fertilization increases the yield certainty at delayed sowing. Harvest index (HI) is the ratio of the kernel yield (t/ha) and the total kernel and straw yield (t/ha) expressed as 100% dry matter. Harvest index was statistically significantly affected by year, fertilization treatment and site. At Hnevceves site, harvest index in 2012 was statistically significantly different from 2010 and 2011 (Table 8). Lower HI in 2010 at Hnevceves was caused by lower kernel yield related to lower TKW; the latter was influenced by stress conditions at the time of grain filling. In 2012 all injected treatments gave higher harvest index compared to the conventional treatment, which may be explained by higher number of ears per spike at CULTAN treatments due to better resistance of dry CULTAN fertilization of plants at the heading stage, which is in agreement with Mori and Inagaki (2012) that higher harvest index is a critical factor for producing greater kernel yield under water deficit stress. At Humpolec site statistically significant difference in HI values was observed between the experimental years. No statistically significant difference in HI values related to the treatment was observed, which is in compliance with the findings of Sigunga et al. (2002) who did not observe an effect of fertilizer with different forms of nitrogen (ammonium nitrate vs. ammonium sulphate) on harvest index under normal conditions. In all experimental years no statistically significant influence of year on HI value was observed at Ivanovice. Lower HI values were obtained at CULTAN UAN treatment in all years; in 2010 it was statistically significant in comparison with conventional treatment. It may be supposed that these plants have the fastest uptake of nutrients that are effectively used in the assimilate formation without storage; they grow faster till the beginning of the generative phase and thus achieve the highest biomass yield. In 2011 and 2012 no statistically significant differences in the HI values related to the fertilization treatment were obtained. The above-mentioned harvest index values suggest that at Ivanovice site the HI values are the most stable despite the weather oscillations.) ",
    "output": "This extensive text details the results of a three-year field trial comparing the CULTAN method of nitrogen fertilization to conventional methods across different sites and conditions. The findings indicate that CULTAN treatments generally resulted in higher yields, particularly under stress conditions like drought and late frosts, due to better nutrient uptake and storage. The study also discusses the harvest index, which was significantly affected by the year, treatment, and site, with CULTAN treatments often showing higher values, suggesting more efficient conversion of biomass into grain.

Long terminal repeats provide the promoters and terminators associated with the transcription of the LTR-retrotransposon by RNA polymerase II (Kumar and Bennetzen, 1999). The internal region contains the primer binding site (PBS) and the polypurine tract (PPT), both used during the retrotransposition process. The PBS is a 10-20-nucleotide sequence located next to the 5'LTR that can partly base-pair with the 3' end of a cytoplasmic tRNA. The PBS is used to prime the synthesis of the first DNA strand during the retrotranscription process. The PPT is a short stretch of purine-rich DNA (8-49 nt) located in the internal region next to the 3' LTR and is used to prime the synthesis of the second DNA strand during retrotranscription.

The function of these aORF-3Rs is not known, but their presence in most of the copies of a family, with a degree of sequence conservation similar to that of other retrotransposon- encoded proteins, suggests that they may be important for the retrotransposition process (Ohtsubo et al, 1999; Gomez-Orte et al.,2013). Although a complete analysis of the presence, species distribution, and types of these aORF-3Rs is not yet available, the current data indicates that some of them are distributed in several species. For example, the sequences of the aORF-3R of RIRE2, Wallabi, and Gran3, from different species of the genus Oryza, show similarities with the aORF-3R of Grande from Zea species (Ohtsubo et al.,1999). Retand aORF-3Rs from S. latifolia show homology with sequences from other species,and sequences similar to PvRetro13 aORF-3R were detected in other species (Gao et al., 2014). These homologies indicate an ancient origin, at least for some of the aORF-3R.) ",

Although the function of these aORFs-3Rs is not fully understood, their widespread presence and sequence conservation suggest a potential role in the retrotransposition process. The text also notes that these sequences show homology across different species, indicating an ancient origin for some of these elements.",

    "input": "(Retroviruses and LTR-retrotransposons share many structural features, and the main difference is that all retroviruses contain a third coding domain in their internal region called env that is located between pol and 3' LTR. Env encodes for proteins involved in interacting with cellular receptors and mediate fusion of the host and viral membranes (Nisole and Saib,2004). Since retrotransposons have an intracellular retrotransposition cycle, it was initially thought that they do not need the ENV protein and, in fact, most do not have it. However, the presence of coding domains in addition to the gag and pol genes between pol and 3' LTR in the same sense as gag and pol (aORFs-3S)have been described in some LTR-retrotransposons in insects (Song et al.,1994) and in plants (Vicient et al., 2001; Wright and Voytas,2002; Laten and Gaston, 2012).They encode proteins with certain similarities to ENV, suggesting that they may also exist in, at least, some LTR-retrotransposons (Figures 1C,D). One of the conserved characteristics of the retroviral env domains is that they code for proteins with transmembrane domains, a characteristic that some of these aORFs-3S also have, which may suggest some functional similarity (Vicient et al., 2001). On the other hand, the retroviral mRNA is usually spliced to give rise to a message capable of expressing the envelope protein. Similar splicing events have been reported for some plant retrotransposons like barley Bagy2 (Vicient et al., 2001). Together, the data suggest that aORFs-3S could encode proteins with functional similarities to retroviral ENV and therefore they are often called env-like domains (Carvalho et al., 2010).However, an ENV-like function in plants remains controversial because the plant cell wall may represent a barrier to the interaction of ENV with cellular receptors present in the plasma membrane. As a consequence, it has been proposed that ENV-like proteins in plants may have a different function than in retroviruses as,for example,to modify the molecular size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata (Carrington et al.,1996) or to serve as chaperone proteins to facilitate replication (Havecker et al., 2004).) ",
    "output": "This section explains the structural similarities between retroviruses and LTR-retrotransposons, particularly focusing on the env coding domain found in retroviruses that is absent in most retrotransposons. However, some LTR-retrotransposons in insects and plants have been found to contain additional coding domains (aORFs-3S) similar to the env gene, suggesting a potential evolutionary link. These env-like domains in plants may not function exactly like their viral counterparts due to structural barriers such as the plant cell wall, leading to speculation that they might serve different functions, such as modifying plasmodesmata or acting as chaperone proteins.",

Antisense aORFs are also present in different retrotransposon families, but their functions are yet unknown. The nuclear localization identified in some cases and the comparison with the antisense genes of retroviruses suggest they may play a regulatory role in retrotransposition. Antisense transcription may also play a regulatory role itself, through a dsRNA- mediated silencing mechanism. In conclusion, we believe that it is necessary to pay more attention to the presence of this type of additional ORFs in the annotations of the TEs.

More than 800 million hectares of land worldwide are affected by salinization (Liang et al. 2018, Feng et al 2019). Salt stress is considered one of the serious threats that restrict crop production in arid and semi-arid regions (Rahat et al. 2011,Kordrostami et al. 2016). Maize (Zea mays) is an important food and economic crop widely cultivated worldwide. However, its tolerance to salt stress is poor. Besides the breeding of salt-tolerant corn varieties, this problem can be solved through the use of suitable exogenous additives to improve the salt tolerance of corn plants. Salt stress reduces the stability of the plant cell membrane and inhibits the photosynthetic rate and the activity of antioxidant enzymes. At the same time, salt stress causes an imbalance in ion absorption by plants, especially sodium and potassium ions, inducing a toxic ion effect. This, in turn, leads to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, causing oxidative damage (Yang and Guo 2018). In addition, salt stress can significantly reduce the accumulation of plant biomass, causing serious effects on growth and development, and then affecting crop yield (Romero-Aranda et al. 2001).

The production and accumulation of ROS in plants under salt stress can increase significantly, causing peroxidation of the plasma membrane and producing MDA. Meanwhile, plants have antioxidant systems that scavenge ROS and contain antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, POD,and CAT (Fariduddin et al. 2013). Lopez-Gomez et al. (2016) reported that the administration of BL helps in reducing the level of plant lipid peroxidation, thereby reducing the negative effects exerted by oxidative stress.In the present study, salt stress simulated using NaCl significantly increased MDA accumulation in both the maize varieties.Exogenous BL treatment substantially inhibited MDA accumulation in both the varieties, mitigating oxidative damage induced by salt stress. In pea (Pisum sativum), mint (Mentha canadensis),and rice, exogenous BL similarly significantly inhibited MDA accumulation in plants under salt stress (Sharma et al. 2013, Shahid et al. 2014 Coban and Baydar 2016).)

In order to increase crop productivity in temporarily flooded soils, the development of flooding-tolerant lines is required. Three primary factors affecting flooding tolerance in plants have been reported: (1) the ability to grow adventitious roots at the soil surface during flooding; (2) the capacity to form root aerenchyma; and (3) tolerance to toxins (e.g., Fe2+, H2S) under reducing soil conditions. By analyzing these components separately, it could be possible to perform selections for genotypes exhibiting varying degrees of flooding tolerance. In quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses for flooding tolerance, using teosinte as a germplasm resource, several QTLs associated with flooding traits have been identified. Based on the DNA marker information linked to flooding tolerance-related QTLs, the potential transfer of QTLs conferring flooding tolerance from teosinte to maize and pyramiding these QTLs into selected maize lines are now possible.)

In this context, we must also take into account the drop in prices and the appearance of diseases, as well as the high production costs and the promotion of monoculture. Agroecosystems can be defined as ecosystems “modified by human beings to a certain degree in order to use natural resources in production processes,” satisfying food, fibers, medicine, and timber needs [3]. Agroecosystems aim to conduct agricultural activity in such a way that an efficient and sustainable production is achieved, adequately and fairly exploiting resources without exceeding their load capacity [4] Agroecosystem design is based on local knowledge about the use, function, importance. and characteristics of species. This subject has been barely studied from an ethnobiologicall approach. Ethnobiology is based on peasants knowledge about the use, interactions, and ceciprocal relations between nature and human beings. The dependence on technological packages, the pollution of aquifers, erosion, eutrophication, and loss of native germplasm of cultivated species have modified the operation and structure of agroecosystems [5]. For example, the loss of microorganisms affects ecosystems, because several processes depend on them, such as the cycle of C, N, and other nutrients, animal and plant health, and agriculture. Agroecology seeks to “restore flows of energy and nutrients within ecosystems and agroecosystems to maintain a dynamic balance between their constituting elements? [6]. This approach goes beyond organic production. It is a transdisciplinary scientific effort that strives to bring together traditional and scientific knowledge to solve problems affecting specific environments. Therefore, it must consider any phenomenon relating to the management and use of natural resources [7]. According to Zambrano[8],as an interdisciplinary science, agroecology requires participatory processes that involve all parties; likewise, it needs to develop proposals that impact the social, economic, and productivespheres. Therefore, agroecology proposes an analysis that allows us to conceive agroecosystem design as a response to rural problems, focusing on the production of healthy food through the implementation of peasant knowledge and organization structures [9]. Agroecology also entails reclaiming a vast lore guarded by communities about the use and management of local species [10]. Safeguarding biodiversity is essential to maintain the dynamic balance of agroecosystems. Their conservation requires the design of strategies that enable the study, protection, and adequate use of species, without exceeding their load capacity —for example, creating seed cepositories. One of the multiple benefits of conservation is the upkeeping of whole sets of species, populations, communities, and ecological services within the agroecosystem [11] Consequently, proposals that respond to productive, economic, and social needs should be developed. These proposals should be based on agricultural lore and its application to the diversification of coffee agroecosystems with local species) ",

In order to answer these questions, we expressed a ratiometric redox-sensitive fluorescent protein sensor, pHyper in C. heterostrophus.

    "input": "(In fungi, the intracellular redox state determines the nuclear retention of a bZIP transcription factor belonging to the APETALA-1 (AP-1) family (Moye-Rowley et al., 1989). The mechanism of oxidant sensing was elucidated in yeast where, in the absence of stress, YAP1 (Yeast Activator Protein 1) is rapidly exported from the nucleus. Oxidation results in the formation of an intramolecular cysteine-cysteine disulphide bond, which prevents the interaction of YAP1 with the nuclear export factor CRM1 (Chromosomal Region Maintenance 1). The oxidation of YAP1 is indirect. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) oxidizes a peroxiredoxin, which then reacts with YAP1 (Delaunay et al., 2000, 2002; Okazaki et al., 2005). The domain structure of the proteins encoded by orthologues of YAP1 in filamentous fungi is similar to that of the yeast protein. Experiments with green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions have shown that they are likewise retained in the nucleus in response to oxidants. Loss of ascomycete or basidiomycete YAP1 orthologues results in hypersensitivity of the mutants to oxidants (Guo et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2009; Lessing et al., 2007; Lev et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2009; Molina and Kahmann, 2007; Temme and Tudzynski, 2009). Furthermore, the mutants fail to show the induction of target genes (belonging to the YAP1 regulon) encoding enzymes that function in overcoming oxidative stress. These phenotypes suggest that YAP1 is essential for the return to redox homeostasis during and following exposure to oxidative stress. This hypothesis has been tested in Botrytis cinerea, where the recovery of the reduced glutathione pool (GSH) was followed with a genetically encoded ratiometric fluorescent sensor: in a mutant lacking the YAP1 orthologue BAP1, recovery of the GSH pool was affected following repeated exposure to H2O2 (Heller et al., 2012).)

YAP1, which is retained in the nucleus upon oxidation, interacts with peroxiredoxin that has been modified by hydrogen peroxide. This interaction is crucial for the fungus's ability to manage oxidative stress, as mutants lacking YAP1 orthologues are hypersensitive to oxidants and unable to induce genes necessary for overcoming this stress. The importance of YAP1 in maintaining redox homeostasis was further demonstrated in studies with Botrytis cinerea, where mutants lacking the YAP1 orthologue showed impaired recovery of the glutathione pool after oxidative stress.",

    "input": "(Producing high yielding maize hybrids and well-adapted to many environments is the most important goal of the National Maize Research Program in Egypt. Genotype x environment interaction (GEI) continues to be a major challenging issue to plant breeders and production agronomists. When genotypes are evaluated over a series of environments, and whenever interaction is significant, the use of overall genotype means across environments becomes questionable. Karimizadeh et al. (2012) stated that genotype x environment interactions (GEI) have assumed importance in plant breeding programmes because the yield performance of a genotype is the result of genotype, environment and their interaction. Khalil et al. (2010) and Maqbool et al. (2019) stated that selecting appropriate and productively stable maize hybrids for cultivation is an effective solution for increasing the grain yield of maize. Moreover, we can select ideal maize hybrids in diverse sites by evaluating genotype and environment interaction (GEI) and their stability. Several parameters have been proposed to characterise yield stability when genotypes are tested across multiple environments, with each parameter giving different results (Temesgen et al., 2015). Becker and Leon (1988) distinguished between two different concepts of stability; static stability and dynamic stability. A genotype is said to exhibit static stability when its performance is unchanged with respect to varying environments, thus implying that the variance of yield or other relevant traits over environments is low. Dynamic stability, has on the other hand, to do with a genotype showing predictable response to environments, and thus showing small deviations from its expected response in the testing environments. The stability statistics per se are not informative and useful in selection unless they are integration with yielding capacity. Thus, efforts have been made to combine yield and stability parameters (Kang and Pham, 1991; Kang,1993). Zivanovic et al. (2004) reported that a strategy that provides a maximal genetic improvement in maize yield must include simultaneous breeding for yield and stability, starting from initial segregating generations. Several other researchers (Tollenaar and Lee 2002; Delic et al., 2009; Mosa et al., 2019: Sedhom et al., 2021) reported that the high grain yield and yield stability are not mutually exclusive in determining selected genotypes. Mosa et al. (2021) found that simultaneously identifying for high grain yield and stability can be helpful in selecting good hybrids in a plant breeding programme.) ",

However, increased digestibility is typically associated with low structural strength and a propensity for lodging. The solution to this dilemma may lie in our ability to optimize maize morphology using tools from structural engineering. To investigate how material (tissue) and geometric (morphological) factors influence stalk strength, detailed structural models of the maize stalk were created using finite-element software. Model geometry was obtained from high-resolution x-ray computed tomography (CT) scans, and scan intensity information was integrated into the models to infer inhomogeneous material properties. A sensitivity analysis was performed by systematically varying material properties over broad ranges, and by modifying stalk geometry. Computational models exhibited realistic stress and deformation patterns. In agreement with natural failure patterns, maximum stresses were predicted near the node. Maximum stresses were observed to be much more sensitive to changes in dimensions of the stalk cross-section than they were to changes in material properties of stalk components. The average sensitivity to geometry was found to be more than 10-fold higher than the average sensitivity to material properties. These results suggest a new strategy for the breeding and development of bioenergy maize varieties in which tissue weaknesses are counterbalanced by relatively small increases (e.g., 5%) in stalk diameter that reduce structural stresses.)

    "input": "(Kernel number per ear (KNE) is one of the most important agronomic traits in maize (Zea mays L.) related to yield, but in breeding practice, maize germplasm presenting desirable KNE is scarce. Traditional breeding efforts for improving the trait depend on a lot of field testing, and accurate field evaluation is often laborious and time-consuming (Duvick et al., 2004). Whereas, marker-assisted selection (MAS), which enables breeders to distinguish genotypes directly, is a better approach for developing desirable KNE germplasm, and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis can help us to understand the genetic basis of a trait, enabling its use in MAS (Tuberosa et al., 2002). Previous studies on QTL mapping of maize ear-related traits focused on these aspects, including yield per plant (Huang et al., 2010), 100-kernel weight (Guo et al., 2008), ear weight (Sabadin et al., 2008), row number per ear (Lu et al., 2006), and kernel number per row (Li et al., 2010). For the trait KNE, although there are also some reports published in the literature (Ribaut et al. 1997; Agrama et al., 1999; Frova et al., 1999; Gallais and Hirel, 2004; Xiao et al., 2005; Prasanna et al., 2009), different parental lines may lead to different results in QTL number, chromosomal location or genetic effect. For example, using X178 and B73 as parental inbred lines, Xiao et al. (2005) identified six QTLs for KNE on chromosomes 1 (three), 3 (one) and 9 (two), but in the report by Agrama et al. (1999), using B73 and G79 as mapping parents, there were four QTLs on chromosomes 1 (one), 6 (one), 7 (one), and 9 (one). Thus, it is necessary to use other parental lines to map the QTLs associated with KNE in maize. These different results may also be due to sampling of the segregation populations used for QTL identification, and the populations in previous studies were focused on F2, possessing the deficiency named temporality (Ribaut et al., 1997; Agrama et al., 1999; Xiao et al., 2005). Alternatively, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population is immortal and can be utilized repeatedly, owing to homogenous genotypes forming segregating populations (Pilet et al. 2001). However, RIL populations have been rarely used to map the QTLs for KNE, despite being frequently applied to other agronomic traits of maize (Tang et al., 2010; Trachsel et al., 2010). Therefore, it is useful to carry out the studies on QTL mapping for KNE using a RIL population in maize.) ",

The text also reviews previous studies on QTL mapping for maize ear-related traits, noting variability in results due to different parental lines and the types of populations used.

Secondary data on yield of maize and wheat crops were collected for the period from 1999-2019 to describe the effects of climate variable namely rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature on yield of maize and wheat. Analysis of time series data on climate variables indicated that annual rainfall was positively related to yields while maximum and minimum temperature had a negative but significant impact on maize and wheat yields. It actually revealed that other factors, such as; type of soil, soil fertility and method of farming may also be responsible for crop yield. Trend in cost as well as income of farmers indicated that income and cost of cultivation has no significant relationship with climate variable.) ",

This study sought to isolate and identify aflatoxigenic fungi, as well as detect the presence of Aflatoxin B1 (AfB1) in maize samples obtained from farmers in the Tolon-Kumbungu district in the northern region of Ghana. Twenty farming communities were randomly selected for the study in consultation with the district office of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA). Samples were collected from 200 randomly selected maize farmers by the composite sampling technique, for isolation of aflatoxigenic fungi by the agar plate method and the detection of aflatoxin. Aflatoxin was detected in maize samples with the Black light, rapid screening and immunoassay methods. Aspergillus flavus had the highest percentage of occurrence (63.7%); followed by A. niger (16.5%), Rhizopus stolonifer (9.3%), Penicillium spp. (6.9%) and Fusarium oxysporum (3.7%).

According to the ITA (2009), more maize is produced annually than any other grain. Global maize production increased from 200 to 600 million tonnes from 1963 to 2003 (FAOSTAT, 2006) and reached 800 million tonnes in 2012 (FAOSTAT, 2012). Maize forms an important component of the diets of many people in the world, especially in developing countries. In Ghana, it is a staple, which is eaten in various forms such as Tuo Zafi (TZ), kenkey, banku and porridge. Its cultivation is also a source of income and foreign exchange for the country. Cultivation of maize is hampered by diseases, which are mostly caused by fungi, with Aspergillus flavus being an important postharvest fungus in grain stores. Among mycotoxins, aflatoxin produced by A. flavus is the most common (Sowley, 2016). Farmers' preharvest, harvest and postharvest activities, and other factors such as temperature, humidity and pest damage affect the level of infection of grains by mycotoxigenic fungi. Fungal infection and/or contamination of foodstuff, animal feed and crops with toxic metabolites results in huge losses (FAO, 2005). Mycotoxins contaminate maize in the field and during storage, thus making the grains unwholesome for consumption. The predisposing factors of infection include improper drying, high relative humidity and temperature, farmers’ production practices such as intercropping with aflatoxin-contaminated grains, early and delayed, harvesting and poorly constructed storage structures (Sowley, 2016).)

    "input": "(Tar spot, caused by the obligate fungal pathogen Phyllachora maydis Maubl. (Phyllachorales: Phyllachoraceae), is a foliar disease that can cause significant damage to corn throughout Central America, South America, the Caribbean, and the Midwestern United States (Liu 1973, Bajet et al. 1994, Ruhl et al. 2016, Mottaleb et al. 2018). Initial symptoms appear as small, chlorotic lesions ~7 d after infection, followed by the development of small (0.5-2.5 mm [0.019-0.098] in diameter), generally circular, brown to black stromata (signs) scattered across the upper and lower leaf surfaces, occasionally coalescing into stripes (Liu 1973). Older leaves are most frequently affected (Liu 1973, Bajet et al. 1994), with symptoms and signs also occurring on leaf sheaths and husks in severe cases (Hock et al. 1992, Bajet et al. 1994). Occasionally, stromata may be surrounded by a necrotic lesion, giving the lesion a “fisheye’ appearance (Kleczewski et al. 2019a). Although the cause of fisheye lesions is unknown (McCoy et al. 2019), severe yield loss of up to 90% has been reported to be associated with these symptoms in Central America (Hock et al. 1995, Pereyda-Hernandez et al. 2009, Mahuku et al. 2013). Yield loss resulting from tar spot has been attributed to reduced ear weight, poor kernel filling, loose kernels, and vivipary, which is a phenomenon where seeds germinate prematurely before reaching maturity (Dittrich et al. 1991, Hock et al. 1995). An increase in the incidence of stalk rots, and a reduction in fodder quality and quantity has also been reported (Bajet et al. 1994, Mahuku et al. 2013). Tar spot is favored by moderate temperatures (16-21°C [60.8- 69.8°F]), a daily average relative humidity of >75%, and at least 7 h of free moisture on foliage. Ascospores are produced in perithecia within stromata, exuded in a gelatinous matrix, and are believed to be dispersed via wind and rain. After infection and an incubation period of 12 to 20 d, new stromata are produced. New ascospores are produced within these stromata soon thereafter. The fungus can survive as stromata on residue for at least one winter under Midwestern conditions (Kleczewski et al. 2019a, Groves et al. 2020). In 2015, tar spot was confirmed for the first time in Illinois and Indiana (Ruhl et al. 2016), and by 2019, it was detected in Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Minnesota, Missouri (K. Bissonette, per- sonnel communication), and Wisconsin (McCoy et al. 2018, Dalla Lana et al. 2019, Malvick et al. 2020). In 2018, persistent, mild and wet conditions throughout corn reproductive stages presumably fa- vored the development of tar spot on corn grown in the Midwest. Field level losses exceeding 3,766 kg/ha (60 bu/A) were reported in some local areas, with Midwestern losses estimated at ~4,500,000 t (177,157,319 bu) in 2018 (Mueller et al. 2019). Documenting the spread and establishment of plant pathogens is important, particularly when the pathogen is new to a particular region and management practices by farmers may need to be de- veloped or altered in order to effectively manage the disease and associated yield losses.

Samples were placed in plastic or paper bags and shipped to the University of Illinois plant disease diagnostic laboratory. Upon ar- rival, samples were pressed and air-dried at room temperature until processing. Three leaves per sample were rated for the percentage of leaf area with black stromata. The incidence of fisheye lesions was determined for each sample by scoring up to 100 randomly selected stromata for the presence of a fisheye lesion surrounding the stroma. A similar method was used in 2019, except no specification of canopy location was made.

We conducted field studies to examine the influence of different environmental factors on leaf primordia differentiation.

Transient gene expression has been used by many researchers to address the aforementioned problem. Applying transient gene expression assay coupled with reliable detection methods significantly reduces the time required for the evaluation of transgene functionality in plant hosts [2]. Indeed, time- and cost-saving are two major advantages of the transient gene expression approach which make it an ideal choice for the initial evaluation of a candidate gene nominated for production of recombinant vaccine [3]. Furthermore, transgene delivered by transient gene expression method quickly stimulates transcription and translation machineries of the host cell which results in high accumulation of the desired protein [4]. Transient gene expression can be realized by various approaches including application of viral vectors, hairy root culture, agroinfiltration, as well as others [5]. Agroinfiltration represents the simplest method for transient gene expression. This method includes simply an injection of Agrobacterium tumefaciens suspension into plant leaves.

In this direction, many plant species have been tested by researchers for their utility as the platform for the production of anti-ND vaccines [8]; but the range of plant host for this purpose is often limited to dicotyledon species. In contrast, monocots are rarely used for the production of recombinant proteins since they are not a natural host of A. tumefaciens which is the main tool for genetic engineering. Corn is a monocot plant that serves both as a fundamental part of poultry diets and as an appropriate platform for the production of recombinant vaccines [9].

Consequently, understanding the mechanisms underlying plant resistance or tolerance helps us to develop fruitful new agricultural strategies. These will allow us to face the challenges of producing food for a growing human population in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way. To compensate for their sessile life and face a broad range of biotic and abiotic stresses, plants have evolved a wide range of survival and adaptation strategies. Amongst them, higher plants are capable of inducing some stress “memory' or “stress imprinting.” Bruce et al. (2007) define stress imprinting as genetic or biochemical modifications induced by a first stress exposure that leads to enhanced resistance to a later stress. This phenomenon also known as “priming” results in a faster and stronger induction of basal resistance mechanisms upon subsequent pathogen attack, or greater tolerance against abiotic stresses (Pastor et al., 2013). Basal resistance by itself is too weak to protect against virulent pathogens, since it constitutes a residual level of resistance after immune suppression by the pathogen through co-evolution (Walters and Heil, 2007; Conrath, 2011). However, Ahmad et al. (2010) proposed that priming-inducing stimuli can provide more effective basal resistance, particularly when an earlier defense response precedes immune suppression by the invading pathogen.) ",

ROS metabolism includes a complex network that interacts closely with hormonal signaling systems and allows plants a subtle regulation of developmental events as well as biotic and abiotic stress responses. Oxidative stress is the term widely used to define the imbalance between ROS production and scavenging or detoxification (Pastor et al., 2013). Recently, a mechanism to explain the role of ROS in cell signaling has been reported. This model proposes that changes in redox homeostasis generate specific ROS signals or ROS waves that, next to other signals such as hormones and small peptides, can prime neighboring cells to defense (Mittler et al., 2011). The afore-mentioned ROS signal waves are sensed by specific receptors that can transfer the message to activate other networks through phosphorylation cascades using mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs) (Colcombet and Hirt, 2008).

The physiological function of vitamin K in plants is associated directly with its redox properties. Quinones, benzoquinones, and naphthoquinones such as menadione have two major chemical properties that render them reactive in biological systems. They may attract electrons acting as oxidant agent or electrophile, and in turn also donate electrons, acting in this case as reducing agent or nucleophile. The grade to which these properties contribute to overall toxicity is highly dependent on the concentration, and the chemical and cellular exposure conditions (Castro et al., 2007).

Another effect of menadione on abiotic stresses is to induce tolerance to chilling stress in maize seedlings (Prasad et al., 1994). These authors suggested that exogenous application of menadione and H2O2 to the seedlings might induce a mild oxidative stress leading to chilling tolerance (Prasad et al., 1994). A very recently published work from our laboratory has focused on the MSB effect at the seed stage (Jimenez-Arias et al., forthcoming). Firstly, we found that soaking Arabidopsis seeds in 20 mM MSB induces salt tolerance by priming an early plant adaptation and proline accumulation. In addition, it was found that MSB primes the expression of key transcription factors such as Zatl2, one of the key zinc-finger proteins encoded by a multi-gene family and involved in a ROS-dependent signaling network against abiotic stress (Mittler et al., 2011).

From the figure we can clearly see the different expression patterns; the expression of several genes was higher in both leaves and stems compared to roots, such as ZmFKBP18 and ZmFKBP19. There were some special genes that only expressed in one or two tissues and not expressed in the second or third tissue. A special gene, ZmFKBP17-2a, appeared to be only expressed in roots, implicating ZmFKBP17-2a in further specific functions. Moreover, for some close relationship genes, they showed complementary gene expression patterns, such as ZmFKBP64a and ZmFKBP64b.

    "input": "(The mouse model used in the STM screen only indicates that a given mutant produced fewer cysts in mouse brains compared to WT parasites. This decrease in cyst counts could be caused by a defect in the ability of the parasite to switch to the cyst-forming bradyzoite form at the onset of chronic infection or by a defect during the acute stage of infection. We examined the ability of C5, 95C5 and Comp1 parasites to develop into bradyzoite cysts in tissue culture using minus bicarbonate, high pH media. In vitro, 95C5 parasites do not appear to have a development defect as they differentiate into bradyzoites similar to both parental C5 and Comp1 parasites (Fig. S1). To determine if the 95C5 decrease in vivo cyst counts is due to an acute stage defect, we tested C5, 95C5 and Comp1 parasites in an acute infection mouse model. In an acute infection mouse model, a lethal dose of parasites is used to challenge mice and time of death is used for comparison between strains. Typically, a challenge of 2x106 C5 parasites will be lethal to the mouse by 7 to 10 days post infection. In the case of 95C5 parasites, mice can be challenged with up to 5x107 parasites and not show any of the typical symptoms of T. gondii infection such as ruffled fur or hunching (data not shown). Comp1 parasites were restored in their lethality as all of the mice infected with this strain succumbed to infection by day 7 post infection (Fig. 2A). The viability and number of parasites used for the infections were verified by plaque assay in order to ensure that each mouse is infected with similar numbers of viable parasites. The complete lack of symptoms even at challenges well over 10 times the normal lethal dose and the restoration of acute virulence by addition of TgTPP1 to 95C5 parasites shows that TgTPP1 is required for survival of T. gondii during a mouse infection.)

Even at high doses, these mutants fail to induce typical symptoms of T. gondii infection. However, reintroducing the TgTPP1 gene into 95C5 mutants restores their lethality, confirming the crucial role of TgTPP1 in the parasite's virulence and ability to cause acute infection in mice.",

India is now among the largest producers of rice, wheat, pulses, fruits, vegetables, milk, cotton, horticultural crops, dairy and poultry, aquaculture, and spices. Agricultural production in India is valued at US$401 billion in 2017, which is more than that of the USA (US$279 billion). Despite this impressive progress, there is no scope for complacency.

In our study, enhanced lipid peroxidation, as indicated by the increased MDA content, and the electrolyte leakage were observed in the maize leaves in response to the 100 mM NaCl treatment.

Our results show that the ratio of AsA/DHA decreased under the salt stress that was consistent with a previous study (Ferreira-Silva et al. 2012). The redox state of ascorbate is controlled by enzymes involved in its biosynthetic and recycling pathways. In the present study, the salt stress increased the activities of APX, DHAR, and MDHAR.

These proteins resist the digestion in the gastrointestinal due to the presence of multiple proline-glutamine residues and most of them are exposed to deamination by tissue transglutaminase. So, ingestion of these proteins damaged the finger-like villi of small intestine. In this case, the body became unable to absorb nutrients into the bloodstream, causing the main nourishment (Bernardo and Pena 2012). At present, gluten-free diet is the only remediation way to prevent its symptoms. Corn, rice, potato, and other tubers, the main gluten-free sources, cannot represent the technological requirements for bakery processing. The viscoelastic properties of these flours depend on the starch component more than proteins component which are not able to form a network (Padalino et al. 2016).

On the other hand, when there is not enough water for plant growth, this can damage the plant with photosynthesis inhibition and formation of radical oxygen species (Abbaspour and Ehsanpour, 2016; Chen et al.2014). This shows that oxidative stress is a critical problem for crop cultivation when plants are exposed to water stress.) ",

Waterlogging reduces oxygen availability, leading to adaptations such as aerenchyma formation, while water deficiency inhibits photosynthesis and leads to the production of harmful oxygen species.

Maximum photosynthetic rate was observed at UV-B1 and UV-Bc (control level) and then declined significantly from UV-B2. Net photosynthetic rate decreased by average 28% in UV-B treated plants compared to the control, and this effect was accompanied by decreases in gs (41.8%) and E (20.6%) (Fig. 1). Exposure of almond plants to the selected UV-B doses induced remarkable alterations in FYs (Table 1).

A reduction in Fv, and F/Fm, was observed with increasing UV-B intensities, but only UV-B2 and UV-B3 levels were significantly different from UV-Be UV-B treatment decreased the F/Fo ratio with about 21%. Fo/Fm did not change significantly with increasing UV-B intensities from UV-Be to UV-B1, but a further increase led to a significant increase of the parameter from about 0.191 at UV-B1 to 0.235 at UV-B3. Fm was not affected by the UV-B radiation treatments and remained constant (Table 1). UV-B radiation caused a significant reduction in Chl a when the intensity exceeded UV-B2 (Table 1). The size of reduction varied ranging from a reduction by 15% in UV-B2 to a reduction by 24% in UV-B3 compared to UV-Be, respectively. A similar decreasing trend was also observed for Chl b, but the reduction of Chl a was somewhat greater than reduction in Chl b. At all treatments, UV-B radiation induced a reduction in total Chl (a + b), but a significant reduction was initiated at UV-B2 and was more pronounced at UV-B3. In contrast, UV-B enrichment did not result in a significant alteration in the ratio of Chl a/b (Table 1).) ",

Thus, selection of the proper period and material is the key to successfully obtaining target genes. In maize, the differentiation of the leaves and roots is highly active during the period of germination to the trefoil stage. The root is the main tissue for most LP gene cloning, which provides a foundation for the successful separation of differentially expressed fragments from plants grown under LP stress (Hernandez et al.,2007). Among the LP stress-related up-regulated genes, several are involved in the degradation and synthesis of proteins. In plants, LP tolerance involves an extremely complicated orocess, and its mechanism relates to each stage of the process. Consequently, there is an obvious change in the protein content in the plant cell when subjected to LP stress. However, the relevant mechanisms regarding the generation of inducible specific proteins under LP stress and the mechanism of response to phosphorus stress remain unclear. Many studies have demonstrated that the gene expression patterns of plants change distinctly (Hammond et al., 2003; Wen et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011, Cai et al., 2013).

China 2Agrotechnology Extension Station, Agricultural Bureau of Weishan County, Jining,Shandong,P.R.China 3College of Mechanical andElectronicEngineering,Shandong Agricultural University Tai'an,Shandong,P.R.China ABSTRACT A BSTRACT in split plot design to study the effects of urea types (normal urea and coated urea) and irrigation on soil and fertil- izer nitrogen use in maize (Zea mays L.) field in 2006 and 2007. Irrigation was used as main plot, and urea types were used as split-plot. Two irrigation levels, no irrigation in the whole growth duration and 85 mm irrigation at the blister stage, were designed. There were five nitrogen treatments, which were no nitrogen used as control (No), normal urea 75 kg N/ha (N1), normal urea 150 kg N/ha (N2), coated urea 75 kg N/ha (C1) and coated urea 150 kg N/ha (C2). The results showed that, at the same level of irrigation and nitrogen, the soil nitrogen contents of the treatments with coated urea (CU) applied were higher in 0~40 cm soil layers, but lower in deeper soil layers, than those with normal urea (NU) applied. Irrigation increased the nitrate losing, but the nitrate loss of CU was lower than those of NU. Using CU with irrigation could increase the nitrogen uptake by maize, and more nitrogen was transfered to grain.At the same nitrogen level, CU had higher N recovery efficiency but lower soil N dependent rate than NU. When applied with CU, the nitrogen release rate was lower and the nitrogen was quickly absorbed by maize, which reduced the risk of nitrogen loss and increased the use efficiency of soil and fertilizer nitrogen. These results suggest that coated urea combined with deficit irrigation should be applied for high yield and nitrogen use efficiencyofmaizeontheNorthChinaPlain.) ",
    "output": "The abstract discusses a study on the effects of different urea types and irrigation levels on nitrogen use in maize fields. It compares normal urea and coated urea under conditions of no irrigation and limited irrigation. The study found that coated urea, especially when combined with irrigation, resulted in higher nitrogen content in the upper soil layers, improved nitrogen uptake by maize, and enhanced nitrogen transfer to grain. Coated urea also showed higher nitrogen recovery efficiency and lower soil nitrogen dependency compared to normal urea. The findings suggest that using coated urea with deficit irrigation can enhance maize yield and nitrogen use efficiency on the North China Plain.",

Maize plants placed downwind of infested, conspecific plants showed reduced larval development not only immediately after exposure to HIPVs but also when receiver plants were tested after a time lag of up to 5 days, compared to those exposed to volatiles from uninfested plants and tested after the same time lag. The molecular basis of this plant memory was, in part, the similarly recalled expression of a Bowman-Birk type trypsin inhibitor (TI) gene, in a jasmonic acid induction-independent manner. Moreover, in the promoter region of TI, a suite of methylation sites was found to be demethylated by the HIPV treatment. These findings provide an innovative mechanism for the epigenetic basis of the memory of HIPV-mediated habituation for plant defence.) ",

Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), including a wide array of low molecular weight terpenes and green leaf volatiles, function as airborne signals within and between plants. Such signals allow plants experiencing them, but themselves not under attack, to tailor their defenses to their current and expected risk of herbivory. In some cases, these receiver plants do not show immediate changes in their level of defenses, but respond more strongly and more rapidly when damaged by herbivores than non-receiver plants. This readying of a defense response, priming, is induced when volatiles emitted from clipped sagebrush affect neighboring Nicotiana attenuata plants by accelerating their production of trypsin proteinase inhibitors only after Manduca sexta larvae start to attack them.)

This phenomenon, known as priming, involves a stronger and quicker response to actual damage compared to plants that have not received such volatile signals.

Since HIPVs are emitted by damaged plants for only a few days after the onset of damage, neighbouring plants can only receive volatile signals when emitter plants are damaged, or slightly later. Moreover, plants cannot be aware of how much later the herbivores will arrive. This issue is relevant to considerations of the ecological consequences for both emitters and receivers.) ",

Over the years and the increase of inputs to conventional tobacco cultivation and the groundwater nitrate pollution, producers and industry began to look at organic farming. However, for the field crop of tobacco knowledge is limited to inorganic fertilization only and it is necessary now to find out the effect of organic fertilization on soil, yield and quality of tobacco. Therefore, two-year field experiments were carried out during 2017-2018 in Agricultural University of Athens. Three oriental tobacco varieties were cultivated (Basmas Xanthi 81, Katerini S53 and Myrodata Agriniou 30A) in split-plot design, with four fertilization treatments (Control, Compost, Manure and NPK). According to the results, the yield was significantly affected only by the variety and the highest yield was 3.488 (kg ha-1) in Myrodata Agriniou variety.

    "input": "(Tobacco is a widespread crop of great economic importance in large cultivated areas. Chemical composition of tobacco leaves is used by industry for a recreational reason, by medicine for medical uses and for biofuel production (Song et al., 2016). For Greece, tobacco is a crop that brings in a lot of income to farmers and organic tobacco is a new industrial product (Bilalis et al., 2009). Despite the great variability of soil and climatic conditions, time selection for leaf harvest, which is defined by mature period, is important for yield and quality of tobacco leaves (Song et al., 2016). On the other hand, nutrient management is very important in tobacco production, as it affects yield and quality to a greater extent (Prince et al., 2015). Nitrogen application of fertilizer increases the number of leaves per plant, size of leaves and therefore yield of “flue-cured” tobacco (Smith, 2009). Flower (1999) reported even the excessive application of inorganic fertilizers with nitrogen, tobacco will take advantage of them and increase its yield. Excess nitrogen can also give off spicy aromas but does not necessarily increase nicotine (Hoyos et al., 2015). The yield, quality and usability of tobacco depend on three important factors: the genetic potential of a variety, the environmental conditions of production and the specific cultivation practices applied to each crop Bilalis et al., 2010). All the experiments that have been done so far show that each factor contributes to the efficiency of production and it is difficult to distinguish who is more important. The genetic potential of each tobacco variety theoretically exceeds some limits in the appearance of a particular trait.) ",

The text highlights the importance of nutrient management, especially nitrogen application, which influences leaf size, number, and overall yield. However, excessive nitrogen might not increase nicotine content but can affect other quality aspects like aroma.

    "input": "(The demand for organic tobacco is 'gaining' more and more ground. There is a growing interest in the cultivation of organic tobacco worldwide, since, in addition to being the final product of conventional tobacco, in terms of concentration of toxic and hazardous substances, it also has advantages such as increasing soil fertility, minimizing producers' exposure to toxic chemicals. Increase in biodiversity, reduction of groundwater and river pollution, reduction of production costs (fewer inputs）and finally increased selling price of the product. The quantities nitrogen applied vary, indicating that they range from 56 (Smith, 2009) to 181 kg ha-1 (Hoyos et al., 2015). Nitrogen is an important element in tobacco fertilization as the concentration of nitrogen in leaves is highly correlated with nicotine (Bilalis et al., 2010; Bilalis et al.,2015;Richmond et al,2016).But, tobacco is a widely cultivated crop, so the environmental impact of adding inorganic fertilizers is enormous. Organic fertilizers enrich soil without disturbing its biological, chemical and physical properties (Bilalis and Karamanos, 2010). Organic tobacco cultivation is not widespread, although other crops have found results equal to conventional agriculture. Other results show that the quality characteristics of tobacco improved in organic fertilization. Jianhua et al., (2006) noted that comparison between the effect of organic manure and inorganic fertilizer with the same amounts of nutrients showed that, under manure fertilization, the ratio of excellent tobacco leaves to total leaves increased. In addition, a combination of inorganic and organic fertilizer in tobacco cultivation improves the quality of tobacco. In particular, it increases the ratio of phosphorus and potassium distribution in leaves and nitrogen in roots and decreased in stems. Also with the increase of cow manure and rapeseed cake nitrogen content in leaves increased. Also, a combination of organic and inorganic fertilizers accelerated accumulation of dry matter of cured tobacco, especially in the later period of growth. Furthermore, quality characteristics of tobacco such as aromatic substances are affected by the organic carbon content of organic matter (Yan et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Because tobacco is a large-scale crop, organic tobacco cultivation can continue to be grown on a large scale. This is very important as controversy over organic tobacco cultivation always arises with the argument that it will not be able to reach yields of conventional agriculture. It was reported that with addition of 25% chicken manure to nicotine, total sugar, total nitrogen and potassium content in leaves were at the maximum levels of flue-cured tobacco. An important element that affects the quality characteristics of tobacco, like nicotine, is variety. Also, chlorine content in irrigation water can significantly affect tobacco quality (Tabaxi et al.,2020). Given the importance of soil fertility and the development of appropriate nutritional strategies for organic tobacco growing, the aim of this study was to study the effect of soil characteristics on the quality characteristics of tobacco and to determine the quality characteristics of tobacco during two growing cycles under different fertilizer sources with an emphasis on exploring the possible replacement of cultivation systems and fertilization strategies applied so far.)

The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is one of the principal polyphagous pests that takes advantage of the no-tillage system. Despite its pest status, little is known about S. frugiperda survival and development in alternative hosts including those resistant to glyphosate. The purpose of this study was to investigate, in laboratory and greenhouse conditions, the adaptive capacity of S. frugiperda in volunteer maize and 6 weeds commonly found in Brazilian agroecosystems, including species with biotypes known for glyphosate resistance, such as fleabane, sourgrass, and goosegrass. We found that S. frugiperda survival and biomass were significantly higher in goosegrass, maize, and johnsongrass in both laboratory and greenhouse conditions. In contrast, fleabane, benghal dayflower, sourgrass, and smooth pigweed caused a decrease in S. frugiperda fitness. Along with S. frugiperda adaptive capacity, our results suggest that its persistence in the field can be directly related to weed control inefficiency during the off-season, increasing the demand for integrated pest and weed management.)

While this is not a new idea, it becomes more important under the twin challenges of cultivating crops in uncertain future climates and the need to increase food production with fewer inputs. However, there is also clearly no point in cultivating crop species simply because they can withstand environmental stresses; they also need to have the potential to achieve high-value markets due to the characteristics of their products; perhaps the functional starch quality is unique or perhaps the levels or combination of micronutrients makes them a highly valuable addition to human nutrition.

These often include; a reduction in seed dormancy, altered morphology, and the loss of seed dispersal mechanisms. Domestication Syndrome Factors (DSF) have also been identified which represent the actual genetic changes which have occurred and one major surprise from this work was that the number of DSFs can be relatively limited. In maize, most morphological changes needed to produce maize from teosinte, the wild progenitor, are controlled by just five genes. In wheat, closer to seven DSFs have been identified.

This is probably more evident than in many other academic communities, because the increasing use of underutilized crops for food security involves overcoming many constraints and obstacles, from genetic through management, cultural acceptability, and marketing, to policy and decision-makers in government. There are good examples of the development of an indigenous crop within its local community where it provides direct benefits to that community through food and often income security providing the local community with purchasing power. The major crops probably represent the other extreme option, with the use of germplasm from worldwide collections, with crops often grown as monocultures under high intensity agriculture and in the presence of global commodity markets. This contrast between promoting the localism and globalization of different crops is often a source of friction within the underutilized crops community. Some social champions may argue that there is little to be gained from recent developments in genetics and research for underutil- ized crop species and that it is not experiment and breeding that is needed, but advocacy. They may point to the model plant species that are supposed to inform research in major crops, where there has been a great deal of money spent on fundamental plant research which may never see any impact in the field. This argument has some traction and advocacy of a similar research investment in hitherto underutilized crops is both implausible and counterproductive. However, we would argue that highly focused, applied research to answer questions fundamental to a crop (such as understanding the breeding system, the population structure of germ- plasm, and for quality control in research and breeding work) is warranted. Work to modify specific quality traits or tackle particular disease issues may also be important, but should not be assumed. Whatever research is done, it must be done as cheaply as possible using whatever tools/information are available from other species. It should have a clear pathway to making an impact and should be means to an end, not an end in itself.

Improving the quality and composition of endosperm through genetic engineering has therefore been the subject of numerous studies, and great achievements have been made in this area (Bajaj and Mohanty, 2005). To increase crop yield, cloning and characterizing endosperm-specific genes or the promoter is important (Smidansky et al., 2003; Li et al., 2011). However, whether foreign genes introduced into target plants or receptor organs can show controlled and stabilized expression is unknown. In most cases, desirable foreign genes were introduced into target plants, specifically into target tissues or cells under the control of a powerful constitutive promoter, such as the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) (Covey et al., 1981) and its derivatives (Rushton et al., 2002). However, the high expression of foreign genes in transgenic plants during all development increases the metabolic burden and wastes, which may lead to a loss of material and energy in transgenic plants (Hsieh et al., 2002; Malnoy et al., 2006). Thus, identifying a tissue-specific promoter to drive gene expression would overcome this limitation. Many tissue-specially promoters have been isolated from various plants, including vascular bundles, roots, leaves, stems, seeds, and fruits. For instance, a fragment sequence from -1677 to -1380 base pairs (bp) was crucial for driving gene-specific expression in vascular bundles (Liu et al., 2001). In the upstream region of the PEPC promoter, a light-regulated and cell-specific methylation promoter in maize was identified (Tolley et al., 2012). Two novel positive cis-regulatory elements (GSEI and GSE2) were reported to be specifically expressed in green tissues in rice (Ye et al., 2012). Endosperm has many advantages as a heterogeneous expression platform compared to other expression systems, including its low cost, stability in storage, and high safety (Takaiwa et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2007). Several endosperm-specific expression promoters have been isolated and analyzed from rice (Rasmussen and Donaldson, 2006), wheat (Wiley et al., 2007) maize (Russell and Fromm, 1997), and barley (Choi et al.,2003). However, few promoters with endosperm-specific expression have been examined in plant genetic transformation studies, as the transgenic plants showed unsatisfactory expression levels and patterns (Li et al.,2008;Qu et al.,2008). In this study, we cloned the PDULLI gene from maize and characterized its function by detecting the expression level of the β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene in transgenic rice. Moreover, GUS activity driven by different promoter deletions were analyzed. The results of this study showed that PDULLI-4 was an ideal endosperm-specific promoter because of its stable and effective expression in the transgenic plant.) ",

These results demonstrated that PDULL1 was a strong endosperm-specific promoter. To further identify sequences essential for high-level expression of the promoter in endosperm, deletion analysis of PDULLI was performed. Four truncated fragments covering the various regions of PDILLI based on the sequencing results were examined for their expression level in endosperm.

This table indicates a difference in the composition of protein and basal energy without nitrogen, between the samples of Biluhu and Wumialo villages. The difference is thought to be influenced by soil fertility.Especiallywhenplanting maize without fertilization The distribution of carbohydrates and nutrients varies significantly among the corns' stover fraction and research sites (Mourtzinis et al. 2016). The protein content of momala is different from that of Pena Tunu ^Ana*, the local variety of Nusa Tenggara Timur, which has protein content of 11.78 ± 0.05%. However, the protein content of momala is higher than other local varieties, such as Piet Kuning, Gumarang and Lamuru (Murningsih et al. 2018) The protein content of momala is also greater than Manado Kuning variety, having 7.71% of protein (Landeng et al. 2017). When compared with hybrid corn, the protein content of momala corn is higher than Bisi 2,while the carbohydrate content in Bisi 2 is higher than momala. Bisil 2 has a protein content of 8.40%, carbohydrates 75.10% (Suarni 2017). Maize or corn with the protein content above 9% meets the SNI standard (1998) of a minimum percentage of 7.5%; the maize is also considered high- protein corn, and such corn can be used as the ingredient off foods, e.g., bread, biscuits, cakes, and other high-protein foods. The proximate composition of momala is also highen than other maize varieties of Kaduna, Nigeria, in which the carbohydrate percentage range was 44.8-69.6%,protein content 4.5-9.87%，moisture content 11.6-20%,fiben content 2.10-26.77%,fat content 2.17-4.43%, and the ash content was 1.10-2.95% (Enyisi et al. 2014). All genotypes of maize have substantial differences in terms of thein chemical and mineral composition (Kabir et al. 2019). On the other hand, the lowest amount of carbohydrate and protein was found in BHM-15 (77.67%）and BHM-8 (10.96%). BHM-13 contains the lowest amount of fiber (1.24%) and fat (4.27%) (Kabir et al. 2019).) ",

    "output": "This excerpt highlights the importance of soil organic carbon (SOC) as a key indicator of soil quality in agricultural systems. It notes that organic farming can increase SOC stocks, as evidenced by various studies. The text also explains that SOC is composed of various compounds with different functions and stability, making soil fractionation necessary for detailed analysis. Labile organic carbon (LOC), a component of SOC, is particularly noted for its rapid turnover and role as a primary energy source for microorganisms, making it a sensitive indicator of changes in soil quality.",

It grows forming clumps that reach 1.2 m in height, being used to extract excellent quality starch, whose fresh rhizome content varies from 18 to 23%, depending on the plant age (Kinupp and Lorenzi, 2014). Starch is the main source of energy of higher plants and is widely used mainly in the food, textile, chemical and pharmaceutical industries, where it has intensified every year, the food sector being the largest consumer due to the use of starch for the elaboration of foods. Studies on new sources of starch and better extraction techniques have been carried out, since the starch characteristics depend on its botanical origin (Abegunde et al., 2013). The main sources of commercial starch are corn, wheat, potato, and cassava. However, arrowroot starch has unique characteristics and qualities, which confer lightness and high digestibility, being used as ingredient or additive in low amounts to improve product presentation or conservation. Due to the ability to form gel and absence of gluten, this starch has been indicated as an alternative for the production of breads, cookies, and cakes (Cunha, 2016) aimed mainly at celiac individuals.)

This study attempts to evaluate maize germplasm for tolerance to weed competition in order to achieve competitive ability and suitability for farming.

The treatment protocol used had a combination of two different cultivation technologies (transplanting and direct sowing) and two different sowing periods (8 and 15 May during both growing seasons). The results show that the different cultivation technologies both had significant effects on the productive properties and earliness of sweet corn. The transplanting variants had about 34% more plants per hectare compared with the direct sowing yield. The ear length and mass were higher in crops grown using transplanting (22.2 cm and 278.0 g, respectively) than in crops grown using direct sowing (21.2 cm and 270.3 g, respectively). During the research period, a significantly higher ear yield was noted in the transplanted variants (11.7 t ha') compared with those of direct sowing (7.6 t ha'). The transplanting variants had earlier harvests by 18 and 16 d in the first and second sowing periods, respectively, compared with those of direct sowing.) ",

Bailey) is one variety of corn whose morphological characteristics and cultivation technology are generally similar to those of other varieties -with some differences. Compared with other corn varieties, sweet corn has a kernel rich in protein, fat, and sugar (Budak and Aydemir, 2018) that is soft, juicy, sweet and very tasty at the milk stage (Ugur and Maden, 2015). Given these characteristics, the kernels are consumed fresh or processed (Rattin et al., 2018) Sweet corn is a thermophilic crop with an optimum growth temperature range of 21-27 °C (Mao et al., 2017; Hacisalihoglu et al., 2018). Cold temperatures (< 10 °C) can hinder growth and can damage plants. The growing demand for sweet corn in recent years (Ugur and Maden, 2015) has resulted in the expansion of sweet corn production to regions with less-than-optimal temperatures for growth. Sweet corn cultivation in such regions results in low and variable yields Furthermore, increasing consumer demand requires extending the supply of fresh sweet corn beyond the conventional season, which is challenging because the quality of the kernel deteriorates rapidly after the milk stage (Alan et al., 2014).)

Characterized by high yield and adaptability to a variety of conditions, maize is preferred over other crops for planting in many countries. To meet the future demand for maize and of maize-based industries, the production of the crop needs to be increased. This can be achieved through two important ways, namely resource-conserving cropping system and use of improved crop varieties. Under modern agricultural conditions, peasants often choose two maize varieties namely hybrid variety and open pollination variety (OPV); their choice relying more on the prevailing environmental and economy conditions) as well as the availability of right varieties for purchase. Hybrids of two mutually independent homozygous inbred lines are more widely used. Most of the world's commercial maize varieties come from the hybridization of two or more inbred or pure lines.

Inducer lines from the Stock6 had haploid induction rates generally between 2 and 8%, and some were above 10% (Eder and Chalyk, 2002; Li et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2013). It is quite easy to obtain coleoptile sections through germination of haploid grains without any influence of season; coleoptile sections are thus a kind of fine explants. In this study, the mean induction rates of haploid callus in Reid, Tangsipingtou, and Term-tropical groups were determined to be 40.24, 37.85, and 15.13%, respectively, which were far higher than those obtained in anther and microspore culture (Szarka et al., 2001; Jager et al., 2005), thereby favoring haploid callus formation. Zhao et al. (2007) treated young haploid embryos or the callus with herbicide that improved the doubling efficiency. Gordon-kamm et al. (2007) treated young haploid embryos with herbicide and doubled haploid stem tip successfully. Haploid young embryos are influenced by season, and this study demonstrated that it was very difficult to distinguish the size of young haploid and diploid embryos and such judgments were often inaccurate. Although haploid stem-tip tissues are fine explants un-influenced by season, it is difficult to peel the stem tip off, and thereby breeding requirements can hardly be met. It is very convenient to obtain haploid coleoptile sections, and some genotypes have high callus induction and differentiation rates. Maize haploid callus treated with certain concentration of colchicine or herbicide solution, differentiated and regenerated, and then double haploid plants were obtained (Petersen et al., 2003). Therefore, doubling of haploid callus or regenerated plants based on further improvements in induction and differentiation rate of haploid coleoptile section callus could be one of the effective ways to improve maize haploid doubling efficiency and to obtain DH lines. Reid and Tangsipingtou maize groups had high induction rates for haploid coleoptile section callus, and differentiated into 8 and 7 haploid plants respectively while the Term-tropical group had low haploid callus induction rate and could not differentiate into haploid plants.)

    "input": "(Improvements in the genetic potential of poultry have resulted in changes in their dietary and nutritional needs. Thus, to adequate the feed formulation to the poultry requirement, it is essential to know the correct energy values and digestibility of nutrients in the feed. In the literature, the traditional methodology to determine the metabolizable energy (ME) of feedstuffs consists of simply replacing a percentage of the basal diet by tested feed (Matterson et al., 1965). Another possibility to determine the nutritional values of feedstuffs is to use them in their pure form. However, Albino et al. (1987) pointed out that the values of ME of feedstuffs can be influenced by amino acid, vitamin and mineral compositions of the diets. In this sense, the addition of some nutrients during the feed test can adequate the diets to the animal requirements, since their concentrations in feedstuffs are not sufficient to meet the requirements (Coehlo, 2000). It is known that unbalanced diets can affect the growth and health of birds (Marks, 1975) and therefore the metabolism of nutrients of the feedstuffs (Lohakare et al., 2006). Studies have shown, for example, that different amounts of vitamins can influence the metabolizability values of nutrients and energy from feedstuffs; among them are vitamin E (Chae et al., 2006), zinc (Trindade Neto et al., 2010), calcium and phosphorus (Cardoso Junior et al., 2010) and amino acids such as lysine (Trindade Neto et al., 2010).

Pure maize with 100% of nutritional correction increased the AMEn in dry matter in 912 kcal/kg (33%), while 50% of correction increased it in 282 kcal/kg (8.4%) compared with non-corrected maize. In the maize-replaced basal diet, the nutritional correction increased the AMEn in 234 kcal/kg (6.6%). These results are in agreement with Avila et al. (2006), who observed that the correction of diets with microminerals, vitamins and choline increased the energetic values of soybean meal. Even working with enzyme complex, Groppo et al. (2010a) also observed an increase of 326 kcal/kg of AMEn in maize when nutritional corrections were made in the diets. These results can be linked to the imbalance in nutrients in test diets without nutritional correction, which can probably lead to lower absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and lower energetic values of feed determined. Considering 100% of corrections, no difference (P<0.01) was observed in values of AMEn determined by pure maize or by the diet partially replaced. However, when the correction was not performed or was partially used, the use of pure maize resulted (P<0.01) in lower AMEn when compared with partially-replaced diet. This result shows that the presence of essential nutrients can influence the energetic values of feeds. Recently, Trindade Neto et al. (2010) verified that lysine levels affected the AMEn values of the diet, but did not observe the same effect with different levels of zinc. Silva et al.

It is important to mention that these authors did not work with a particular feedstuff, but the little variation of some nutrients can influence the energy values of the feedstuffs and probably of the diet as well. This occurs because of metabolic changes due to imbalance of dietary nutrients. In the present study, where there was a wide variation in nutritional composition between experimental diets, such metabolic changes can be better evidenced. In this case, the nutritional diet corrections may be important to estimate of energetic values of feeds, leading to an adequate balancing of diets to poultry These results suggest that the energy values normally determined with no nutritional correction may be underestimated, probably due to the greater deficiency of vitamins, minerals and amino acids, mainly in pure) ",

These findings align with previous research indicating that dietary adjustments involving micronutrients and vitamins enhance the energetic values of feedstuffs.

Centromeres are defined by the presence of a centromere-specific histone H3variant, cenH3 (CENP-A in humans) (Henikoff et al. 2001). In many higher eukaryotes, centromeres are composed of long arrays of a single family of satellite repeat (Henikoff et al. 2001; Jiang et al. 2003).For example,human centromeres contain megabase-sized arrays of the 171-bp alpha satellite repeat (Willard and Waye 1987; Vafa and Sullivan 1997). Centromeric satellite repeats can evolve rapidly, which may result in different centromeric re- peats among closely related species (Lee et al. 2005).Thus, a new centromeric repeat can sweep through the entire ge- nome and rapidly replace the old repeat in all centromeres via poorly understood mechanisms.The cenH3/CENP-A nucle- osomes in rice and humans are highly phased on the 155/ 171-bp monomers of the CentO and alpha satellite repeats, re- spectively, and show a distinct structure compared to canonicall nucleosomes (Hasson et al.2013;Zhang et al.2013b).

That the ratio of GCA to SCA is greater than 1 indicated that the component of the additive gene action is higher than that of non-additive action in the inheritance of most of the traits tested under optimal environment. Thus, selection methods will be more adequate for the improvement of the most traits tried under stress-free environment (Edwards et al.1976).

To meet this challenge, one of the possible answers is to breed more efficient cultivars adapted to environments with low phosphorus (P) availability, as in the case of Brazilian soils, to be able to decrease agricultural inputs and reduce environmental pollution and production costs. Phosphorus is one of the most relevant primary macronutrients for nearly all crop species, due to the functions of this nutrient in vital plant mechanisms. To meet the growing demand for P fertilizers, phosphate rock mining increased fivefold between the 1960s and 2011, and the global production of P fertilizers increased at an annual rate of 4%. The reserves of this non-renewable natural resource are likely to be exhausted within the next 50 years.

Producer's corn requires protecting seed before planting; using fungicides, insecticides and synthetic dyes as yellow, green and pink to prevent consumption by people [2]. Studies show that a co-occurrence of fungus and mycotoxins in harvest and post-harvest maize is possible around the world [3], but there is not enough information in the chemically treated seed previously sowing. Mycotoxins are a group of secondary metabolites produced by different fungus in maize, one of the most toxic compounds known for humans [4]. The aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), is carcinogenic; Ocratoxine A (OTA) and Fumonisins are genotoxic, immunotoxic and recently classified by International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2B group of substances possible to human carcinogenic [5] [6]. Esterigmatocistine (ST) is hepatotoxic; in general most of mycotoxins are immunosuppressive [7], indeed it is important to know their exposure since a chronic exposure to low levels can give diseases like cancers [8], additionally it is not well known about the possible interaction between multiple mycotoxins [9] and on the other hand, fungus and mycotoxins would remain in environment (air, soil, water), due to their stability against degradation [10]-[12]. Among the identified fungus in post-harvest are Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus parasiticus, Aspergillus ochraceus which are producers of Sterigmatocystin, Aflatoxin B1, B2, G and G2 and Ochratoxin A; Penicillium spp, producer of Roquefortine C and Mycophenolic acid, Fusarium verticilliodes (Zearalenone, Deoxynivalenol, DAS, Nivalenol, T-2, HT-2, Fusarenona X, Fumonisin B, FB2, FBs) and Alternaria alternate, Alternariol (AL) and Methyl ethyl alternariol (AM) [13]. Various methods have been used to isolate and quantify the levels of mycotoxins, such as liquid chromatography with fluorescense detector (HPLC/ FLD), high performance liquid chromatography coupled to system triple-quadruple mass spectrometer (HPLC- MS/MS). In Mexico official tests to determine the presence of AFB and total aflatoxins (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG2, AFM1) are HPLC/FLD [14] [15].

    "input": "(Over the years, farmers have been faced with challenges of weed infestation that needs to be addressed because it negates optimum crop yield. The presence of weed seeds could be due to the presence of weeds in the soil seed bank or non-native seeds brought in with crops. Weed is an important pest of crops that has the potential of reducing crop yield if not adequately managed. In Nigeria, maize is currently an essential cereal crop for a good number of people; however, weed infestation limits its continuous production (IITA, 2012). Severe weed infestations have resulted in up to 89% loss in maize yield (Imoloame and Omolaiye, 2017). Chemical herbicides do work, but croplands end up having weeds that are resistant to these herbicides, hence the need to adapt integrated weed management which includes cover crops. Over reliance on chemical herbicide brings about numerous ecological and crop management problems that have deleterious effects on the health of the ecosystem. Soil void of mulch is usually prone to problems such as wearing of top soil, fertilizer and pesticide runoff into underground and surface waters. The use of intensive fallow systems that are cost effective and environmentally friendly using promising leguminous cover crops could proffer solution to these problems (Awodoyin and Ogunyemi, 2005).)

The study was a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with six treatments and four replicates. The experimental plot dimension was 19.4 m × 13.5 m which resulted in an area of 262 m2. Each replicate had a dimension of 2.5 m × 1.6 m with an alley of 0.5 m between two blocks.

    "input": "(The maize + Cowpea (40,000 plants / ha) plot did better in 'smothering' weeds, as the weed dry weight was less than what was obtained from other treatments. There was better land coverage in maize plots inter-planted with V. unguiculata which resulted in cutting off weeds from solar radiation. The shading led to a marked reduction in the ability of the weeds to photosynthesize, and hence low biomass accumulation. The lowest value of weed biomass consistently recorded in the plots of maize and V. unguiculata interplant, suggests smothering of weeds by cowpea. The highest weed biomass was recorded at weedy control (MwC). Weed dry weight is a vital tool to authenticate the impact of weed management on crops and their associated weeds. This agrees with the findings of Mashingaidze (2004) on maize - beans intercropping, who observed a reduction in weed dry weight by 55-66% when planted at a population of 222,000 plants/ha for beans corresponding to 33% of maize population (37,000 plant/ha). In a report by Bilalis et al. (2010), intercropping maize with leguminous vegetables significantly decreased weed density relative to maize monocrops. This is attributed to the reduced illumination available in maize legume intercrop for weeds. This brings about a decrease in weed density and weed dry weight when compared to mono crop. Rao (2000) claimed that a kilogram of weeds usually correlates to one kilogram of crop yield loss in the field. In this study, the ability of V. unguiculata to effectively suppress weeds may have been either through interception of light from reaching the soil surface or by inhibiting weed growth by the release of allelochemicals. The laboratory analysis revealed that V. unquiculata has high secondary metabolite in the shoot and root (Woghiren et al., 2020). Previous studies revealed that cover crops could smother weeds either by decreasing resource accessibility (Ngouajio and Mennan, 2005) or by impairing the growth of weeds through the secretion of allelochemicals (Reberg-Horton et al., 2005). Cover crop can help to alter prevalence of weed interference by denying weeds the opportunity to use water, light, nutrients as well as soil (Ngouajio and Mennan, 2005) and the structure of weed vegetation (Wright et al., 2003). The ecosystem of soil microbes can be changed by the leftover parts of cover crops or increase microbial diversity, ensuring better soil micro-organisms predation of weeds and decreased weed seed potency (Ngouajio and McGiffen, 2002). This could also influence weed population flux (Jordan et al., 2000). The treatment plots were dominated by species in the Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae families. The abundance of the Asteraceae and Poaceae families may be due to the fact that they are the largest families of the dicotyledons and the monocotyledons. The major weeds encountered in the treatment plot comprised categories of weeds which are grasses, broad leaves and sedges. This findings agrees with the result of Taah et al. (2017) in which they observed the Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae families to be the most prominent families in a cassava and legume intercropping system.) ",
    "output": "The text discusses the effectiveness of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) as a cover crop in maize fields to suppress weeds. The study found that the highest density of cowpea (40,000 plants per hectare) was most effective in reducing weed biomass by blocking sunlight, which inhibits weed photosynthesis and growth. The success of cowpea in controlling weeds is attributed to its ability to cover the ground quickly, intercept light, and possibly release allelochemicals that inhibit weed growth. The findings are supported by previous research on intercropping and the ecological benefits of using cover crops to manage weed populations and improve soil health.",

Small decreases in the ruminal acetate to propionate ratios, the digestion of fiber, and milk fat percentages have resulted from an increase in the ruminally fermentable carbohydrate load in diets fed to lactating cows, suggesting a predisposition of cows to mild acidosis. The inclusion of 3g/d of a culture of Aspergillus oryzae in the diets of lactating cows increased milk production, feed efficiency, and tolerance to heat stress in some, but not all, studies. Increased numbers of cellulolytic bacteria, higher fiber digestibility, more rapid turnover rate of ruminal lactic acid, and a more stable ruminal environment have been associated with the addition of A. oryzae to ruminant diets.

Its growth is expansive due to its adoptability to different farming systems (Samson et al.,2014). Besides, the crop is adjustable to different regions of the world (Paterson et al.,2017). Maize contributes to high food security especially in developing countries. With the rising human population all over the world, maize production needs to be supported by all means (Jancic et al., 2016). In Kenya, farming is the key driver of the country's economy (Okioma et al.,2020). To small scale farmers, maize provides 60% of dietary calories and over 50% of proteins (Tobin-West et al.,2018). Small scale farmers grow about 2 million hectares annually with an average yield of 1.2-1.6 tons per annum (Odhiambo et al., 2013). The biggest drawback to maize production is infestation by fungi (Chaubey et al., 2015). Some fungi produce mycotoxins which impact negatively to human and animal health (Surendra et al., 2011). Mycotoxins are carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic (Salau et al.,2017). In addition, they cause impaired growth in children and sometimes immunosuppression (Sangares et al.,2016). Mycotoxins cause leuco-encephalomalacia in horses, pulmonary oedema in pigs, liver and kidney cancer in mice and rats. Fungal growth is increased by high temperature, humidity, monsoons, low rains and flooded conditions (Affeldt et al.,2014). Poor harvesting and postharvest practices predispose maize to fungal attack (Zajc and Gunde-) ",

Maize's adaptability to various climates and farming systems supports its widespread cultivation. However, the production faces significant challenges due to fungal infestations that produce harmful mycotoxins, affecting both human and animal health. These mycotoxins are linked to various diseases and conditions, exacerbated by environmental factors like humidity and poor agricultural practices.",

In the water pretreatment, seedling root tips were exposed to water in an open tray. As such, this pretreatment was not anoxic. By exposing the seedlings to a hypoxic condition before the anoxic stress, the water pretreatment improved the survivability of corn seedlings by about 40% over the non-pretreated roots. This process, known as acclimation, has been reported by Saglio et al. According to these authors, the tips of unacclimated corn roots died within 9 h of strict anoxia. However, tips of roots that had been acclimated by pre-exposure to 2 to 4 kPa partial pressure of oxygen for 18 h survived in excess of 22 h of anoxia.) ",

In many regions of Japan, soybean seeds are sown in a paddy field during the summer-rainy season, and excess rainfall after sowing can often lead to soil flooding. Flooding after sowing causes severely decreased crop yields. These lower yields may result from the collapse of cotyledons due to rapid imbibitions of water (Nakayama et al. 2004) and from serious damage to the root system. Accordingly, it is important to understand the mechanism of the flooding stress responses in order to improve crop yields. However, the flooding stress responses in soybeans are not well characterized. Studies of the responses of soybean seedlings to flooding stress showed that flooding inhibits root elongation and hypocotyl pigmentation (Hashiguchi et al. 2009) and affects the expression of some proteins involved in the processes of fermentation (Russell et al. 1990), the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (Shi et al. 2008), glycolysis, protein storage, and defense against disease (Hashiguchi et al. 2009). Since alcoholic fermentation is the major fermentation pathway of glycolysis in anaerobic plants (Rees et al. 1987;Komatsu et al. 2010a), the mechanism of tolerance to flooding stress should include the upregulation of genes engaged in glycolysis and alcohol fermentation.)

Approximately 9.4% of the loss of total annual corn production is caused by pathogens including fungi, bacteria, and viruses, resulting in economic losses. Although the use of fungicides is one of the most common strategies to control corn diseases, the frequent use of fungicides causes various health problems in humans and animals. In order to overcome this problem, an eco-friendly control strategy has recently emerged as an alternative way. One such eco-friendly control strategy is the use of beneficial microorganisms in the control of plant pathogens. The beneficial microorganisms can control the plant pathogens in various ways, such as spatial competition with plant pathogens, inhibition of fungal or bacterial growth via the production of secondary metabolites or antibiotics, and direct attack to plant pathogens via enzyme activity.

Viral-encoded movement-proteins are occasionally known to interact with plant channel proteins to allow virus movement from cell to cell [10,11] Although baculoviruses are capable of infecting animal cells [12,13], they are not known to be pathogenic to plants [8].

The same was not observed for PAE (0.14's). Despite the correlation being significant for PUE, it is important to notice its very low magnitude, which leads to a very low coefficient of determination (O.10).

Similar results were observed by GUIMARAES et al. (2007) in maize and AGUIAR et al. (2007) in Eucalyptus. According to FALCONER & MACKAY (1996) heterosis is composed of: i) dominance deviations different from zero, ii) genetic divergence and iii) complementarity. Thus, this lack of relationship between genetic dissimilarity and heterosis, can be attributed mainly to the low accuracy of the markers to predict the complementarity among the parent in crosses, i.e., the low accuracy to predict the dominance deviations by molecular markers. It is evidenced in the case of combination 5x5', which presents the highest measure of dissimilarity between their parents, but only the 25' position among all 41 hybrid combinations evaluated for PUE.

Mushrooms could be an alternative solution to the world's food crisis as they are inexpensive to grow on different types of substrates including waste materials. Pleurotus ostreatus, frequently known as oyster mushrooms, are the second most cultivated mushroom in the world. This species is known for its high protein content and easy cultivation. Oyster mushrooms have the potential to produce protein-rich biomass when grown on various substrates. There is a need to identify substrates that are cost-effective for the commercial production of nutritious oyster mushrooms as the substrates used currently are either costly or inadequate to produce oyster mushrooms in the required quantity or quality. Thus, the effects of 6 different lignocellulosic substrates on the growth and nutritional composition of P. ostreatus were reviewed and analyzed in this article. The substrates included in this review were wheat straw, sugarcane bagasse, corncob, softwood sawdust, hardwood sawdust, and general sawdust.) ",

The samples' genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using the CTAB procedure specified by CIMMYT (2005). All 20 pairs of SSR markers used in this investigation were extremely polymorphic, resulting in 122 repeatable and polymorphic bands that were scored with an average of 12.20 alleles. Each primer yielded a main allele frequency of no more than 0.5. The average major allele frequency for the 10 primers was 0.3036. with an average of 0.8334, all markers had gene diversity values greater than 0.6. Similar to this, the Polymorphic Information Content (PIC) values had an average of 0.8164 and varied from 0.9051 (primer umc1042) to 0.6639 (Umc1669). Since primer umc1042 best identified this variability, the frequency of the main alleles generated by each primer points to the presence of significant molecular genetic variation across the samples under study. This occurrence is further supported by the gene diversity (GD) and polymorphism information content (PIC) values of the primers. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primers are all appropriate for genotyping genetic diversity. Due to their different genetic relationships, varieties IWD C2 SYN F2 and SAMMAz 52 have the most diversified genotypes and can be utilised as parent materials in a maize breeding programme.) ",

Due to the ongoing rise in global population, further economic and agronomic development of some of the important characteristics is imperative (Xiao et al., 2017). Any known organism's genetic material degrades due to the stretching of current or old variations brought on by agricultural advancement. This may be due to the introduction of new cultivars to replace ancient landraces, increasing urbanization, the effects of climate change, and population growth (Prasanna, 2012). The genetic resources with the most favourable alleles include landraces and wild ancestors. These can be utilized to strengthen the genetic foundation of ongoing breeding initiatives. Additionally, genetic diversity aids in defining heterotic groupings, determining the level of genetic variability, and identifying core subsets for particular features (Semagn et al., 2012). Crop genetic diversity has been studied using a variety of marker approaches, including morphological, biochemical, and DNA-based markers. DNA-based markers are unaffected by agro-climatic edaphic conditions or the plant's growth stage; they are therefore preferred to morphological and biochemical markers (Govindaraj et al., 2015).) ",
